I was told I could pay a high monthly amount or go into forbearance. I chose forbearance, because my XXXX XXXX husband and I could not afford the high monthly rate on his income.

7/15/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"I would first like to say I have never once defaulted on my student loans nor can I recall making a late payment ( not saying it hasn't happened, I am just unable to recall at the time of composing this letter. ) I have struggled with Navient and their unfair business practices for quite some time. Their representatives have always taken on a more aggressive tone when I've outreached the company over the years of my loans being in repayment ( since XX/XX/2010 ). 
I have always needed some type of program assistance in repaying my loans. The only assistance offered over the years has been a forbearance period ( where interest continues to accrue while not being obligated to pay ) and an interest rate reduction program. While struggling to repay loans each month, i've always made due, especially when single and without the responsibility of maintaining a household. 
While I continue to submit my financial status on a yearly basis, lately I have grown more frustrated as it appears that Navient continues to provide a monthly repayment amount that is not conducive to my situation. What is the point in disclosing all your financial obligations to a company just for them to provide you with a figure that THEY feel is reasonable?? I am not only repaying repaying Navient for my private loans but also repaying my federal loans through a different servicer as well. Several weeks ago, I phoned Navient ( as i often do ) in effort to discuss the figure they provided following the submission of my financial status documentation, due annually. I was provided with $ XXXX/mnth. I  explained to the representative if there was any way I would be able to qualify for a lower payment as it would be a great hardship in trying to make that payment each month. The representative ( in which I regret not taking his name ) stated that there was no other lower payment options available to me. I advised the representative that it wasn't the fact that i didn't want to pay, it was more of not having the funds to pay that given figure. The representative callously informed me that if i wasn't able to pay then i would simply default on my loans ( which I am aware of ) and have them sent to collections to be dealt with. I was really taken aback by the representatives remarks as that isn't the goal of anyone who cares remotely about their credit. I am maintaining a household in which I am also the "" breadwinner ''. On top of weekly daycare expenses, mortgage, car payments, utilities, groceries, medical bills, and monthly federal loans expenses, i am drowning and wish there was more that could be done in lowering my payments with Navient. It has been so frustrating with dealing with Navient regarding a plan that works for me, not just a plan that they come up with that they simply advise "" it's as low as you can go. '' In closing, this complaint is more two fold, as one sees, I am not only having issues lowering my monthly payments but also having revolving issues with the lender/servicer ( Navient ) as well.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",DE,197XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,7/15/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2963484

8/25/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"This complaint is about American Education Services ( AES ) regarding a government payment made to AES which was incorrectly dispersed to the wrong loan sequences in XXXX. AESs actions negatively influenced future payment decisions due to that error which was not discovered by the borrower or rectified by AES until XXXX. This mistake has left the borrower with a significant amount of interest which accrued on an incorrect balance during the borrowers time on XXXX XXXX in the military. 
During the time period of the borrowers military service, 5 private loans and 3 federal loans were in deferment or forbearance, respectively, and were accruing interest on the total balance as payments were made. The borrower was aware that interest would be accruing and that the borrower would have to pay the interest, or allow it to capitalize. The borrower believed that each consecutive year, the borrowers loans would be accruing on a balance significantly less that the year prior, due to the borrowers enrollment into the Student Loan Repayment Program. 
At the time of the borrowers entrance into the military, the borrower was offered and had accepted the Student Loan Repayment Program ( SLRP ). This program permits the government to pay 1/3 of the original principle balance every year for 3 consecutive years during military service to equal the entire principle balance. The SLRP applications are to be filled out for each loan by the borrower, the lender, and the XXXX ( Human Resources Command ) and then government payments for the school loans will commence. The borrower filled out all required paperwork and sent it to AES to fill out its respective section. Then AES sent the applications to the Human Resources Command ( HRC ) as per the instructions. The borrower filled out 8 total applications, 5 private/ 3 federal and sent them to AES . AES then sent over applications to HRC. HRC processed the applications that AES sent and initiated government payment of the loans. 
InXX/XX/XXXX, the borrower discovered that AES dispersed the first government payment inXX/XX/XXXX to all 8 loans, but in XXXX and XXXX AES only disbursed the 2nd and 3rd iteration of the government payment to the 3 federal loans. 
After realizing AESs mistake, the borrower notified AES of the issue and attempted to get an explanation. The borrower then realized that the government payments should have been significantly more than what was actually made during XXXX, XXXX, andXX/XX/XXXX. AES told the borrower that the 5 private loan applications were denied due to a date discrepancy and were not passed on to HRC to for processing. HRC confirmed that they only received 3 federal SLRP applications. 
After further investigation, on XX/XX/XXXX an AES agent ( XXXX : ID # XXXX ) told the borrower that AES sent written notification that the 5 private loan applications were denied and had sent letters of denial to the borrower and HRC via regular mail on XX/XX/XXXX. HRC confirmed with the borrower that it did not receive a letter ( see attached ). The borrower did not receive a letter in the mail at that time. By accepting the first government payment and disbursing to ALL 8 loans onXX/XX/XXXX, AES implied that the paperwork for all loans was filled out and processed completely. 
Until this new information was discovered by the borrower, neither the borrower nor HRC had any reason to believe there had been any issue because neither party received the letter of denial in the regular mail. From XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, only AES was aware that the private loan applications were denied, which meant that the borrower was still accruing interest on a much higher balance than it should have been. No further attempt to contact HRC or the borrower occurred, even as the borrower regularly contacted AES to confirm loan payments during that time period. 
Since the discovery of the disbursement mistake, the borrower is no longer XXXX XXXX military but corrected paperwork for those 5 private loans have been completed, government payments have been made, and all loans are now in good standing under repayment status. 
AES refuses to back date this newly made government payment of {$24000.00} to the dates of XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX ( the payment should be divided into thirds [ {$8200.00} ] as the 3 government payments previously made to AES under the SLRP on the dates listed above ). These are the dates when the private loan payments should have been made along with the federal loan payments, if AES had not disbursed government funds incorrectly and AES had sent denial letters via certified mail. 
1. Borrower is requesting that AES back date the payment {$24000.00} by dividing it into thirds {$8200.00} ( to simulate 1 payment per year of service in XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ), and apply a {$8200.00} payment to XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
2. Borrower is requesting AES correct the accrued interest on the new balance of the loans after each backdated payment is applied. 
3. Borrower is requesting a policy change that requires any loan application notification or any significant loan repayment issue be sent to military members directly via certified mail and require receipt confirmation from service members to ensure service members are fully aware of potential loan issues while serving on XXXX XXXX.",,AES/PHEAA,MD,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/25/17,Closed with monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2651089

My loan is in good standing and I make regular payments well above the minimum and have an auto-debit feature for increased payments. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016 I entered XXXX. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, AES processed an automatic enrollment in a deferment without my knowledge and against my best interest since I was at least a XXXX student. 
I immediately protested on the very next day and asked for the deferment to be removed since I intended to make payments regardless of my status as a student as is my right. 
An agent of AES contacted me via email and claimed that it was in my best interest to have the loan in deferment, since the loan was subsidized and I would not pay interest. 
I responded immediately via email that the loan was not subsidized and a deferment was not in my best interest because not only would the interest accrue but I would lose the rate reductions in place on my automatic payments and the loan interest rate itself would rise because they charged more during deferment periods than payment periods. 
The agent claimed that was not true but they could process a removal of the deferment. 
I responded via email to reverse the deferment, it was not in my best interest. 
Another agent responded via email that I was in fact right, and they could reverse the deferment and put my loan status and payments back as they were, but they would not accept any more email communication and they would not correct the loan status until I write them another communication via post. 
The loan is small, the rate is small, and the interest charged in violation is small, so It would not be in my best interest to escalate to the point of damages, but these agents have fiduciary responsibilities to service accounts in the person 's best interest and can not change the considerations to the agreement to best fit their bottom line especially when a violation like this is immediately caught, protested, and a request to return to a payment status is made.",,AES/PHEAA,CO,809XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,10/25/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2177089

These loans were reopened by Navient and I spent over 3 hours on the phone ( Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX ) going in circles with different agencies and they all sent me back to Navient. Prior to this and afterward I spoke with representatives at Navient and asked if they could defer my payments until the issue was resolved and I was told that because my payment was in the window of repayment I need to call back. I get the same response every time I call back. I can pay the first loan payment on XX/XX/XXXX of XXXX but I ca n't afford the payment amounts that are estimated to be over {$500.00} for the following months. In addition, I do n't want to request a reduced payment which includes payments that have already been discharged. The representatives that I spoke with at Navient agree that my student loan total is {$49000.00} but they ca n't tell me why the past discharged loans are showing up on the student loan website or how to remove them.

After a bit of back and forth the rep did change my loan back to spreading my payment evenly across all loans.

When the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program was announced we contacted our servicer and were told we had everything in order to have the debt forgiven. Every so often we called, and each time were told we were on track to have debt forgiven. 

Fast forward a few years. Our children attended college, and again we had multiple places where we needed to pay for student loans. We decided to consolidate our debt. We filled out the paperwork, but were told if we consolidated we would lose the ability to have any of our debt forgiven. We cancelled the consolidation.

Recently we realized we had made the required 120 payments and filled out the paperwork to have the debt forgiven. We received a response that no debt could be forgiven because we had the wrong type of loan. 

Disgusted, we decided to consolidate into a Direct Loan and try again. That was when we were told that it wouldnt work because my husband was not listed as the holder of the loan. All our student loan debt had been shifted to me, and I dont qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.

What I did get was an alert that a negative item was added to my credit reports on XX/XX/2018 saying the account was 60 days past due ( which doesn't make sense since I made a payment in XXXX ). At this time I checked my account and saw that it had no past due notice ( please see the attached pdf, page1 ). When I clicked into the account details, it also said nothing about being overdue and next payment was due XX/XX/2018. ( page 2 ).

Checking the other details, I saw no records of any previous billing statements. All the payment was either not correct ( some screens said the payoff amount was {$1800.00} and others said {$1900.00} ). One page had XXXX for principal owed and paid even. Nothing was correct here ( pages 3 & 4 ) I tried to contact customer service but was not helped very well at all and instead was deferred to a different department and told they can only be contacted by phone, of course the hours were not convenient to  my work schedule or hard to get a hold of. I tried contacted customer service again and again deferred to a phone number to call. You can see some of the chat log from the first conversation I had. 

During that time I tried to make payments to update the account but had any number of problems doing so ( it wouldn't take my bank account info or reset the information ). I had made a payment before, I couldn't understand why it was so difficult at this point. I finally got a payment to go through on XX/XX/XXXX, for {$280.00} AND set up automatic, recurring payments so this would not happen again ( see page 8 ). I received an email a few days later saying the payment was rejected, then yet another one saying the payment was reversed because "" Unable to Locate Account. '' ( page 9 ) At this point I checked the account and all I could see was the this strange account info ( page 5 ). I could not make any payments and all the info was completely off now, saying the principal owed was {$100.00}. It showed that I made a payment XX/XX/XXXX as well. Again, other info was all XXXX or very wrong. ( page 6 & 7 ) At this point I wanted to pay off the loan in full but I could not contact them. I tried finding email addresses to contact but only found one, and was given a reply that Heartland does not do any business regarding Perkins loans over email. 

After this exchange I checked the National Student Loan Database and discovered that the loan had already been to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2018. I was never informed this would happen in any way, again all my information was current and correct. Now that account is reflected on my credit report as well.",,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,CA,941XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/19/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3023888

3/25/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"Request for Credit Reversal and DisputeMy name is__ and I am a United States XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Veteran who is appalled at the treatment that I have been receiving from Sallie Mae , Inc . I 've served my country honorably as an officer for 21 years and never thought that my financial future would be scarred by a student loan company. My XXXX credit has been damaged due to errors and misinformation given by Sallie Mae loan representatives. As the cosigner on my niece 's student loans, I am requesting a credit reversal of the derogatory information that have stained my credit reports. I 've also discovered that there are thousands of online customer complaints documenting the same errors, inefficiencies and misinformation made by Sallie Mae employees. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, I spoke to XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) regarding loan __. I told him that my niece and her family were undergoing economic hardship and that my retired status, along with the care of my Mom placed me in a difficult position in terms of repayment of the loans. XXXX mentioned a forbearance option. I stated to him that my niece and her father had been granted the maximum in forbearances stated by Sallie Mae. He then stated that since the family was still undergoing economic hardship that he would appeal to management for another forbearance, provided that I would pay a {$50.00} fee and give him a financial statement over the phone. I asked if deferment was an option, and he said no because my niece was not in school. I gave him the information, paid the {$50.00} fee, XXXX assured me again that he would do everything he could to get a favorable answer from management regarding the forbearance request and to keep my credit from being negatively affected at XXXX. He said if he was n't able to do it, I would receive a call. I never received any follow up calls stating that the forbearance was not approved. 
On the XXXX of XXXX, I called Sallie Mae 's military division to inquire about additional programs for veterans and it was there that I was told that the forbearance that XXXX had processed was denied and the derogatory information was reported to the credit bureaus. The representative said that XXXX should have told me that it was not likely that another forbearance would be granted because of the XXXX opportunities had been exhausted. I also discovered that with the approved forbearance in the past, that Sallie Mae never went back to re-adjust the days past due and those were also on my credit reports. I paid the {$50.00} in good faith and was misinformed and disregarded. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2015, my niece and her father called and spoke with XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) to request a forbearance for loan__. XXXX took their financial information and said that he would push for a 60-day forbearance, however he could n't guarantee it but would work hard to get it approved. They called back after not hearing from Sallie Mae on that day and was told by a Sallie Mae assistant that nothing was done yet. They were then transferred back to the forbearance department and XXXX took the call and said that everything had been take care of and that someone would call. When the payments were late, I received numerous calls throughout the day. Each time I called Sallie Mae and was told that a follow up call would be made, no one called me, regarding a status update. 
During the early part of XXXX, I spoke with XXXX ( Sallie Mae representative ) and was given information that was reported after the previous forbearance had been approved. My niece and father were told by XXXX that with each and every forbearance, that it should have been only XXXX 30-day late reported. Sallie Mae dropped the ball several times and we were penalized for the misinformation and faulty loan servicing The derogatory late payment information damaged my credit-a credit reversal is requested.",Company believes complaint is the result of an isolated error,SLM CORPORATION,NC,282XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/25/15,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,No,1300677

I'm trying to have my security clearance reinstated ( it was revoked because of the negative past due for this loan ).

I went back to school in XXXX because I was still not making enough to repay the loans, {$600.00} per month is what was required. I am no longer able to defer or go into forbearance. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX claimed they would consolidate/refinance my federal loan and had this GREAT offer for me! Income driven repayment {$54.00} per month the first year, it would gradually increase over the years, and by the XXXX year the rest of the loan would be forgiven. They sold my loan to XXXX, turns out it was a 20 year loan and nothing will be forgiven. The person who set this up, XXXX is his name, lied to me, and I trusted them. 

Now, I still have $ XXXX with Navient. I am currently on income driven repayment at {$240.00} per month. Next year that will go up. I am still barely able to make these payments. 
I tried looking into the lawsuit against XXXX XXXX XXXX, and tried to get in on that class action lawsuit because I fit right in with that group of students who were promised a large salary job and it never happened.

I have my mother as a co-signer and she is now XXXX years old, and I can not get her off the loan because I had to be in forbearance. I also thought that I was able to consolidate all of my loans, including this XXXX, and so I missed a XXXX of payments, so they wo n't let her off the loan, and this is a hardship on her, having it on her credit report. 
My other student loans were forgiven because of my XXXX, this company would not allow the loan to be consolidated, they could have if they wanted to, and therefore it has become a huge financial burden to me and my family. I told AES of the financial difficulties I had with paying the loan back, they told me to go to school and use the XXXX GI bill and get the money from that to pay back my loan to them.

Working as a regional airline pilot during time of medical leave we are not paid. During this time I was unable to pay my extremely high student loan payment of {$1000.00} a month. After contacting the lender they offered no assistance with lowering or modifying the payment to become affordable while on medical leave. With this the loan went into a state of past due and has damaged my credit to the point where I can not get approved for other consolidation loans to fix this issue. Wellsfargo also stated that I can not receive a loan modification because my co signer and myself still meet the requirements for a loan with them. However we were recently denied a request for a new consolidation loan with them.

3/30/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Good morning. Ive been trying very unsuccessfully to have an issue resolved with Navient about discrepancies on my credit report. These discrepancies have adversely affected my credit score and caused me to be denied because of these errors. Ive called several times and the associate has said they would get pass on the information to a manager for resolution. The issue is that my loan ( even with XXXX XXXX  ) had been in forbearance at various times. However, when I began to work I was able to have payments automatically taken out each month on a combined balance vs. two balances. Even though the payments have been coming out monthly, Navient still has several ( at least 13 or more ) missed payments showing up on my credit report. This should not be because of forbearances and monthly payments. When I could not pay, I kept this balance in forbearance. 

Not only that, these late items seem to have a fee associated with each of them which increases my debt. This must be corrected and I have tried and tried to get this resolved through Navient. I saw the lawsuit and was wondering if this has something to do with it as well. I need Navient to clean up this financial mess they have caused me. Additionally, Ive worked for XXXX  for several years and Navient will not accept me into the program to release debt after so many years of on time payments. I have at least six years or more of continuous payments which I should be able to use. I was denied because of the sort of loan this is under, but that does not seem right especially when payments are being made without fail on a continuous basis. I also want those fees and the added debt incurred monthly backed out of my balance. 

I seems like Navient is trying to keep me indebted to them vs. helping me to eliminate this debt. 

Please respond. 

Thank you, because I really need my credit report cleaned up like yesterday!",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",OH,450XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/30/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2860107

11/20/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"I took out student loans in 2006 to cover the cost of my attending XXXX college. I needed the loans because XXXX college reused to refund my tuition for a semester that after I had already left the college. I have been paying on my loans for years and the balance has only gone up. During that time I have gotten married and had XXXX children so my financial situation has changed significantly. 

I am currently in good standing with my lender but had to put my loans in forbearance sue to being laid off ( see attached ). While in forbearance I applied for extended my request was denied ( see attached ) on every single XXXX of my loans saying that my maximum terms were already met. Literally they are saying that there is no other option to pay my loan other than to pay them an unaffordable payment or go into default. 

I took these loans out before the financial crisis and they were paid to an institution that ultimately kept money from then XXXX XXXX for a semester that I did n't attend. These loans are following the same unsustainable path of the mortgage crisis and to make it worse the loans are not secured by any type of physical asset. 

Every month I am forced to chose between providing a decent life for my family and making payment to a student loan company that I simply can not afford. I have stayed current on my loans for years, and find it unacceptable that a company with such a horrible reputation be able to do this to my family and myself. 

I want Navient to work out a payment that I can afford even if I have to pay more in terest over the long term I must protect my family today.

2 ) I believe they have changed the initial interest rate and are charging an excessive amount of late fees while approving a forbearance and allowing me to not pay down on my loan while it accrues interest. 

3 ) How can I have different "" loan accounts '' for the same school achieving the same degree? Shouldnt this allowed to be consolidated into one loan that I can pay for instead of several different loans with a minimum payment of XXXX dollars.

3/27/17,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"In XXXX, while my son ( XXXX ) was XXXX to XXXX, my wife and I co-signed student loans for his spouse, XXXX, the initial total amount was {$19000.00}. XXXX and XXXX later divorced in XXXX. 
In early XXXX, due to my wife 's failing health, we attempted to refinance our home. However, our loan was denied because as co-signers for XXXX 's loan, we had too much outstanding debt. 
Up until this point we were under the impression XXXX was making payments and assumed the debt was either paid off or greatly reduced. Navient did not make contact with us, as the cosigners, to inform of us otherwise. We had no idea she had been granted deferments or had not been making regular payments to reduce the principle. At no time were we, as the co-signers, contacted by Navient to be made aware she was requesting deferments elongating the duration we would be responsible for the loan. 
I contacted Navient in XXXX XXXX, which then erupted in an onslaught of correspondence which previously had been lacking and frankly, had it been Navients practices from the beginning, I would not be in the situation in which I find myself. Unlike the primary borrower, my contact information has never changed and any correspondence would have been promptly answered. 
At no time, as the co-signers, were we ever notified, consulted, or conferred with when she deferred the loan. Prior to XXXX XXXX XXXX, we had never received any late payment or missed payment notifications or any communication which stated the loan itself had been deferred. As I stated, we were under the impression, XXXX was making payments and the loan was either paid off or close to being paid off as almost 10 years had passed since the origination of the loan. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received correspondence from Navient informing me XXXX had been granted forbearance for a period XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received correspondence informing me payment arrangements for the loans had changed, with a list of XXXX possible reasons. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received correspondence informing me XXXX of XXXX possible events occurred on the loans necessitating correspondence. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received documents I had requested regarding the loans. It was also around this time ( exact unknown ), I requested and was granted online access to the loan accounts, from which I can see payment, deferments, and forbearance. Again, I stress, information I was not made aware of prior to XXXX XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, I received correspondence detailing annual information for cosigners. Another document I had not received prior to this date. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX, again received correspondence informing me payment arrangements for the loans had changed, with a list of XXXX possible reasons. 
I find it unacceptable that correspondence between Navient and I, only occurred after I contacted Navient and XXXX had been granted repeated deferments and forbearance without my knowledge or approval. As a cosigner, what are my rights? No updates, no correspondence to inform co-signers that she could be reevaluated based on her credit or that after making payments for a 24-month period, she could release cosigners. 
The dynamics of the relationship between us changed once she and my son divorced and she cut communication. I have been unable to contact XXXX ; attempts to call her last known phone number, use her last known email address, and mail certified correspondence to her last known physical address have gone unanswered, returned ; all have been unsuccessful. 
As a creditor, Navient can easily review her current credit report and will find, based on her current employment and current credit, XXXX can assume full responsibility for these loans and release the cosigners.

Not once did I receive ANY information about the default. After having my Federal Income Tax Return Offset from the Department of Labor did I go to NSLDS to look at the status of my loans. 
Only then did I see the status of my loans. And how many I had considering I went to a two year technical school. 
So many different loans, different due dates, different rates ... .over the course of two years? 
I have been struggling to find work this last year and really needed my income tax return as my child and I had lost our home due to my unemployment. And yet Navient got it all.

11/10/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I submitted my application for re-paye. I was notified that I had missed the due date for this income based repayment program and then I was told I had a large balance due because I had missed this reapplication date. This took me by surprise because, based on my promissory note, and prior applications for repay, I was several months ahead of schedule when I submitted the application. When I brought this up with the company, they apologized and said that my loan had to be been reorganized under their company and thus my repayment had changed. They failed to notify me of this and thus never provide any documentation saying that I had a change to due date, that I was past due for this application, or that I should reapply for repair on a different schedule. They admitted fault in this, advised that I go on administrative forbearance, and continue to make my new payments. I did all of these things. However I noticed that my loan was still past due after 2 months under the new repay agreement and after I had supposedly gone into administrative forbearance. I called them back, and that 's when they informed me that my administrative forbearance had been denied. This is a surprise to me because I was told I was not applying for administrative forbearance, rather that it was granted given a special circumstance that had occurred. At this point, my loan is coming dangerously close to 90 days past due. I was then advised to reapply for administrative forbearance, disenroll from auto pay, then reenrollauto-pay, this trick as a called it within reset my past due amount enroll the amount owed back into the original principal of the loan. Further, they continually advised me to go into forbearance. Advising that forbearance would forgive this 5 to {$6000.00} debt that I supposedly had accrued. Unfortunately, I am a military member attempting to receive a military loan repayment. This program, unfortunately, will not make payments on loans that go into forbearance. Thus, FedLoan 's solution of forcing me into forbearance is a non-viable option for me. I was further advice to call them back today, XX/XX/XXXX. Since my last discussion with them, I have not received a response to my request to stop automatic payment, I have not been notified of the administrative forbearance approval, and when I called back today the loan company was closed for the holiday ( despite them telling me to call on this date ). My account will become 90 days past due despite my following all their instructions and my attempts and to correct their mistakes. Despite these efforts, it looks like that I will go into delinquency on the loan. This is particularly upsetting for me considering that I have made all of my payments on time since graduating from XXXX school. I would appreciate any help your organization could provide me in mediating this conflict with my Loan Servicing Company. Of note, I also have loans with other loan companies and have never had these sorts of problems.

Charge XXXX : Violation of Equal Protection under the Law The Department of Education ( D.O.E. ) moved to take adverse action against the complainant on XX/XX/XXXX when they failed to serve the complainant with a notice of intent to sue and moved to enter a judgement against the complainant. More importantly, the complainant would argue that whatever information D.O.E. used to obtain a judgement was erroneous, fraudulent, and deceptive to the court. Whenever a government entity moves to take any adverse action of a United States citizen in a court of law, that citizen is protected by the presumption of innocence and has the right to defend themselves from any judgements or adverse court actions. The complainant was residing at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX Al and attests that he was never served at his residence of record. Those fraudulent adverse actions taken against the complainant has caused excessive interest and collection costs to have been accrued towards his loans and the XXXX. continues to apply monies paid to the interest that continues to accrue and never to the principal. These practices constitute loan shark tactics against its consumers without any legal protections. 
Charge XXXX : Violation of the Student Loan Rehabilitation Act Once the complainant entered into a payment agreement with the XXXX, and made XXXX consecutive timely payments, those loans should been rehabilitated and interest rates lowered as those loans would no longer be in a default status.

I am a XXXX who qualifies XXXX for Public Service loan forgiveness -- however -- due to the practices of a company I fortunately am no longer with I can not use this Shortly after I graduated my loan was sold to Sallie Mae -- I had no say in this and it took many years and law changes for me to be able to transfer my loan. 
I have a fixed interest rate at 8 % and Sallie Mae would change this at whim to as high as 40 % -- I often did not notice this till tax time -- when I would call them they would put it back but I was told nothing could be done about the accrued interest it was a computer error. 

Sallie mae told me they did not offer public service loan forgiveness -- or any other of the relief programs offered by the government because they were a private lender ( so I was unable to have an income based payment of any kind ) Recently about 2 years ago my loan was able to be move ed to XXXX XXXX XXXX -- I filled out all the documentation and for Public Service Loan forgiveness and I qualify for the time I have been with them ( my school qualifies and I am on a income based repayment plan ) -- however for the years I was not with them I did not qualify because I was not an an income based repayment plan ( through no fault of mine the company did not offer it and I did not choose the company I had no say in them getting my loan ) So even though I am no longer with Sallie Mae they are still drastically effecting my ability to repay this loan -- not only did the principle double while I was with them -- but they did not offer federal programs that would of allowed me to be nearly finished paying this loan. 

During the time I was with Sallie Mae I was in a better financial situation-and was able to pay my loan consistantly-Since XXXX 2011 my husband has become a XXXX XXXX veteran -- we have been living on XXXX salary ( mine ) I have had to place my loan in deferment in order for us to survive while we are working on getting him social security. Even though I support him XXXX financially I am not allowed to claim is as a dependent on my taxes which would help lower my income sensitive repayment -- -- -I do not know if you send information to the government on possible relief situations but for those XXXX XXXX persons or spouses of people with XXXX XXXX I believe there should be some sort of loan forgiveness program And as far as the public service loan forgiveness is concerned maybe some changes should be made -- -If a person meets the job qualifications they should qualify no matter what type of repayment schedule they were and are on -- -as I am sure Sallie Mae is not the only company that does not offer income based repayments Thank you",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WV,24986,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/15/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1870290

12/8/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I logged into my Navient account on their website. I was setting up a budget for the next year and I noticed my balance due is approximately {$18000.00}. This balance is for 3 private student loans I have through Navient. I had received these loans in XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. My original loans balances ( added together ) was approximately {$19000.00}. As of this date my loan balance is approximately {$18000.00}. In XXXX, I was paying a payment of approximately {$450.00} ( 3 months ). That dropped to {$130.00} ( for 2 months ). It was then raised again to {$230.00} ( 18 months ). Then my payment dropped to {$180.00} ( 18 months ). Then it raised again to {$210.00} ( which I  have been paying since XXXX ). Navient states that my expected pay-off date is XXXX. I was looking at the break down of the payment and how it is applied. I am pay way more toward interest then I am toward the principal every month. One of my loans balance started off at {$5500.00}, its balance is now {$5400.00}. And I have been paying on that loan since XXXX. Another one of my loans original balance was {$7000.00}, and its current balance is {$6800.00}. Again I have been paying on this loan ( the longest ). My 3rd loan original balance  was {$7000.00} and its current balance is {$5700.00}. I understand that I have somewhat high interest rates ( 12.875 %, 11.75 %, & 10.375 %, respectively ) and my rate is variable, however I feel that my balance should be decreasing more. I had contacted Navient in the past about difficulty making payments. I was set up on payment plans that last approximately 18 months. But again my INTEREST payments are greater than {$150.00} but my principal payments are usually less than {$65.00}! I was also charged a disbursement fee of {$210.00} on my 1st loan in XXXX. I have several principal payments that are less than {$20.00}, but the principal payments were greater than {$160.00}.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",KS,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/8/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2749821
3/21/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Denied loan,"I attempted to apply for a student loan from Sallie Mae last month on their website and got a denial. I assumed it was due to requiring a cosigner the information. The information was unclear as to actually why I was declined. I asked for a letter. I then attempted to apply with my wife online and also got denied. I was confused by this because I personally have cosigned for my wife as we are both in school at XXXX XXXX University. The second application should not have been an additional hit to my credit as I just applied and I was under the impression that any hit on my credit lasts for 30 days so I was shocked when the credit bureau alerted me about this. 

I tried to contact them several times about this and reached no conclusion as to why I was unable to acquire the loan. I then called in about the loan and I was told that the loan was denied but they did not know why but I was encouraged to do a new application over the phone. I finally took them up on that when I tried to do a cosigned loan with my father. I was then told that my loan was declined and that I or one of my cosigners had a loan in default. As both my wife and I are in school I was shocked about this. I went to all of my student loan providers Sallie Mae ( I cosign for my wife ) and Federal loans they stated that I had no loans in default and if I had any loans in default I would not have been able to receive the aid I currently have. They reiterated that I was eligible and perhaps I need to use another loan provider for my private loans. I am very leery about applying for another student loan until this matter is cleared up. 

I reviewed my credit report which also had no issues about student loan default, I always pay all of my bills on time including my house and car. Both my wife and I contacted both the national and student loan providers all having no issues with all my loans are in school deferred. Talking to the people over the phone they had a problem even finding my information or how to help me try to rectify this issue. 

This is the first time I have ever needed private student loans due to the loss of my gi bill veterans educational benefits expiring after 15 years. After trying everything I could as I a non-traditional student I have no one left to cosign for me even though I can cosign for my wife. I just do not understand this. The loan company Sallie Mae has now hit my credit XXXX times when I expected once. They have no way to evaluate what or why this is happening to me.

11/20/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I was asked to recertify my student loan as part of the proof of income requirement on my loan. I was under an Income Based Repayment Plan for the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness program with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

My husband had been laid off and did not work the first four months of the calendar year. While my income had rose, I asked that my monthly payment not be increased, due to my husbands loss of income ( I am the only student loan holder but we file our taxes married filing jointly ). I provided the documentation as requested, including our last tax return for XX/XX/XXXX ( it was my understanding they were using our XX/XX/XXXX tax return 's adjusted gross income amount and also took into consideration my husband 's reduction in income based on his submitted pay check copies ). The monthly loan payment at that time was {$950.00}. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX approved this request in XX/XX/XXXX and did not raise my monthly payment amount. However in XX/XX/XXXX, due to a job reassignment and our family situation, I chose to go back to my formeXXXX XXXX XXXX, resulting in a 30 % pay deduction. I requested a lower monthly loan payment evaluation in XX/XX/XXXX, due to the reduction in income, under the Income Based Repayment Plan. I filled out the IDR request forms as required, and included my XXXX XXXX contract and the up to date paycheck copies for my husband. 

The first problem I had was XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me an e-mail and letter that my payment was going UP, not down to {$1400.00}. I called customer service and they explained my contract from my district was not enough I needed a letter from my employer stating my current gross income. The representative said I did not need to resubmit my husbands paystub copies. 

I faxed in the letter stating my salary as requested. The next week I received an email stating this and my loan type had been changed : We recalculated your monthly payment for the Revised Pay As You Earn ( REPAYE ) plan. 
Your total monthly payment amount is {$1900.00}. 

Upon receiving this e-mail I once again called customer service. For the past month and a half, I get no resolution the representative can not help me. What kind of loan company raises a rate when someone asked for a decrease due to loss of income? The e-mail also mentions I am in a Revised Pay As You Earn plan which I have not been nor did I request to be switched to. It has always been the Income Based Repayment Plan. When I estimate our gross income for XX/XX/XXXX, it is about {$65000.00} less than our XX/XX/XXXX AGI and I have provided the documentation to support this. This is not even including the itemized deductions we will be taking on our XX/XX/XXXX return. My payment should not be increasing. The documentation I supplied, as per their IDR forms, states they are supposed to take the paystubs and letter into consideration. They keep insisting they are using the payment amount based on our XX/XX/XXXX AGI on our XX/XX/XXXX federal tax return, but yet the IDR request forms required that I submit documentation, which was the paystubs, which show the reduction in income. Everytime I talk to them, no one explains why these are n't being used to determine my payment. 

My biggest concern besides not being able to afford {$1900.00} a month. I had to put my loan into forebearance, which will delay the 120 payment terms of the Public Service Student Loan Forgiveness program requirements. I am currently in year 3 and have 7 years left in my payment plan.",,AES/PHEAA,CA,925XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/20/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2734437

Additionally in the same response Account Control Technology INC provided promissory note applications with loan amounts of {$0.00} for ALL XXXX loan applications through XXXX XXXX. Therefore they have agreed that they are falsely claiming a debt is owed and collecting through an illegal means.

My issue is with my creeping interest rate. Currently, the interest rate on this loan is at 9 % after Navient, again, has increased the rate.

I called  Navient o n   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   and was told my interest rate was variable, based off of the  LIBOR rate and my credit score.

I filled out the forms and spoke with a representative on, XX/XX/XXXX. They Stated that they had received my Application and that all I needed to do was send my proof of income. I am currently not working and I thought I made that clear during the process so I sent in an email my husbands proof of incomes detailing how often he is paid, which is all the information they requested. I put my account number in the email, and I left a phone number requesting a Call if there was any other information they needed to process the application. I called on XX/XX/XXXX to verify that my email was received. They stated that they had the information and that it should take a few weeks to process. I assumed this meant that everything was squared away and that I had completed my end of the process. I continued to make my normal payments. On XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my account and noticed that my payment had jumped from XXXX to XXXX. I immediately called the customer service line. When I asked why the payment had increased the representative stated that it was because I never re-certified my income. When I tried to get ask why my information was not processed I received unhelpful answers. I was first told that they never received my e-mail. When I stated that I was told by a different representative that they had indeed received my email on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that it was impossible because they do n't have access to the email, and that no one would have told me that they received my information that quickly because it takes 48 hours. I then gave her the date and time that the email was sent, and asked to have her look at it she stated that she did not have access to the email. I then asked to be transferred to someone who does have access to the emails and she stated that the department that has access to it does not have phones. I then asked how I can resolve this issue, as I had sent the information in a timely manner, and am now being told there was no way for customer service to check. She stated that I could resend my information. This was unsatisfactory to me as I had already done so, and had proof of doing so and it still was not processed correctly. I then began questioning the legality of what was being done with regards to my account and she stated that she would put me on hold and try to find someone with access to the email account. When she returned she stated that she can not access the emails, and upon further review of my application my documents were received and processed on XX/XX/XXXX, but that they still needed my personal proof of income. I asked how I was supposed to provide proof of income when I do not work currently, as only my spouse is working. I was told I filled out the application wrong and that I needed to send in a letter stating that I currently have no taxable income. I then asked why no one notified me, as I clearly stated in my email to contact me if any more information was needed and the response was that she did n't know.

It was processed by our bank on that date. 

However, due to the payment address on MOHELA 's site not being clear, they cashed the payment but sent it to the wrong address. This delay allowed additional interest to accrue on the account after the date upon which the total interest balance was to have been paid off. 

Both my wife and I spent extensive time on the phone with MOHELA, and were assured that the problem would be rectified. Upon our last phone conversation, a manager told us that it had been fixed, and that the payment would be applied to the interest balance, as we 'd specified. 

Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from MOHELA for an unrelated issue ( they ca n't get our mailing address correct ). Out of curiosity, I asked the representative to confirm that the interest payment had been applied to my account as it was supposed to have been. It turns out it had n't. They applied part of the payment to the interest balance, and part to principle, allowing additional interest to accrue on the unpaid interest balance. 

This is clearly intentional profiteering. Both my wife and I had repeatedly told and been assured by MOHELA representatives that our payment would be properly applied, which would have paid off any accrued interest balance. By improperly applying our payment ( and lying to us about it ), MOHELA is attempting to profit by charging us interest on a balance that was to have been paid in full nearly a month ago. 

Yes, I could have caught this earlier by checking their website, but frankly, that should n't be my problem. They made an accounting error, and we spent a great deal of time getting it worked out with them. My wife and I should n't be expected to babysit the company further, checking their website constantly to insure that they simply do what they were supposed to have done with our money. 

Supposedly this is to be resolved "" sometime this week '' according to the representative I spoke to today. I was not given any kind of date, and was told that I have to just keep checking the website to see if the problem has been fixed. At this point, I have no faith whatsoever it will be corrected.

I have been paying on a {$16000.00} dollar student loan for 13 years, for classes from a for-profit school, XXXX XXXX University. After looking into it theres been some serious mishandling from the beginning. They have not complied with the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. There is also missing payments. The amount I paid for years is not what they have on file. They have changed the terms of my loan without my permission. Harassing and threatening my co-signer, by making false accusations that I was not making the payments when I was. Scared her into making payments. Sending me and my co-signer statements with different balances. Those are just a few of the many issues Ive had in the past 13 years and Ive had enough. When I got out of school and couldn't find employment XXXX XXXX refused to help me in any way. I decided to join the military on XX/XX/XXXX because I wanted to serve my country and the incentive of the Service Members Civil Relief Act. It caps interest rates at 6 % on pre-existing loans and looked like the answer to get out of student loan debt quickly. I contacted XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and provided them with proof of my XXXX XXXX service. XXXX XXXX lowered my payments but raised my interest rate soon after. But with me being a young adult with not a whole lot of experience with debt and loans, all I saw was a cheaper payment and continued with the impression everything was going the way it was required to. I also contacted them about the debt relief program, I was told my loans did not qualify. I lost all hope in ever getting it paid off in a reasonable amount of time. I'm so sick of this burden, it is a constant reminder of a bad decision I made to chase a dream that only became a nightmare. On XX/XX/XXXX my mother cosigned on a student loan through XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX program, for the amount of {$16000.00}. We were advised by XXXX XXXX 's financial aid administrator to receive our student loans through XXXX XXXX 's program. On XX/XX/XXXX my mother received a Past Due notice. This payment was not past due. Also in my mothers past due bill under Principal Balance it says only {$16000.00} was left on the loan. On the same past due statement I received, shows the Principal Balance to be {$18000.00}. You will see from just a few of the many documents I have, that there is something seriously wrong. First attached are the faxes from XXXX XXXX acknowledging my XXXX XXXX service in the XXXX. Then the contract for {$16000.00}. Following a few billing statements showing my payment history. These show many examples of the higher payments my mother was paying, that does not coexist with Navients payment account history. One statement shows, a last payment received on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$200.00}. Now when I go into the loans account history with Navient it shows only {$140.00}. This type of mishandling goes on and on. Then you will find just a few of my payment stubs to show that payments my mother made are completely missing from the account history. Ive included one of the checks made out to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. In the amount of {$210.00}. Navient shows nothing in that amount for the time frame. I believe for profit schools like XXXX XXXX University and student loan providers like XXXX XXXX and Navient, designed these programs to fail so they could make huge profits. Now that I have a service connected XXXX through the military and live on a very tight budget. I've paid XXXX XXXX and Navient almost three times the costs for an unaccredited education from a school designed to make a profit off the youth of our country.

3/29/16,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"I have a private loan with Wells Fargo that I have paid on time religiously for 4 years. The payment is $ XXXX but I always pay {$200.00}. Over the years I frequently paid well before each month 's due date so that I would not forget. Recently, I received an email that my XXXX, 2016 payment, due on XXXX/XXXX/2016, was past due. This was confusing as I 'd made the XXXX payment on XXXX/XXXX/2016 -- after I paid the XXXX bill on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ( due on XXXX/XXXX/2016 ). I do n't think it is unreasonable to assume that, given my history of early payments, and that my XXXX payment occurred after the XXXX payment and billing cycle, that my XXXX/XXXX/2016 payment was intended for XXXX. 

I called Wells Fargo and was told that any payment made 20 days prior to the due date would be counted as an additional payment, not for the next month due. I should be clear again that I did n't overpay XXXX by {$200.00}. I made a separate payment of the same monthly amount that I always had, frequently very early, with no issue at all. I was told that the XXXX/XXXX/2016 payment could not simply be applied to XXXX but had to be refunded. I was then told that, because I do n't have a Wells Fargo checking account, that my payment would have to be refunded by mail, which would take "" a minimum of 3 weeks. '' I was having this conversation with Wells Fargo Customer Service on XXXX/XXXX/2016, 6 days after the XXXX due date. This meant that Wells Fargo 's own process for refunding a payment that should have applied to XXXX would indeed have made me delinquent for the month. Is it fair that a financial institution can structure payments and refunds in such a way that it makes an otherwise responsible and timely customer delinquent on their debts? I raised this question to the Wells Fargo staff who informed me this was "" just the way it is. '' To which I responded with skepticism, saying that this new system was probably just an inventive way of generating late fee revenues in a low interest rate environment. The representative said nothing. 

I called Wells Fargo again today, XXXX/XXXX/2016, to ask about the status of the refund. I was told it would be returned in the same manner in which I paid -- electronically to my non Wells Fargo checking account. This is welcome news but in direct contradiction to what I was assured was the only method of refund just 1 business day prior. Even the representative today could n't explain the change ( which had not been pro-actively communicated to me in any way -- as far as I knew I should be watching for a paper check in the mail in 3 weeks time ). Was the initial response on Friday a way to make me open an account with Wells Fargo that I otherwise would n't have? I have no idea but the inconsistency is as unprofessional and unfair as the initial insistence on delayed paper check refund itself. 

This is unacceptable behavior from a financial institution that has a responsibility to treat clients with respect and holds so much power over that individual 's credit history.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,NJ,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/29/16,Closed with explanation,No,No,1854602

I was not ever familiar with the name Navient. All of a sudden received mail forwarded from a previous address move 1 Month prior that my loan was defaulted. I expressed that I wasnt familiar with a consolidated loan and none of my 10-15 federal student loans ever defaulted. I repeatedly recvd phone calls and mailings immediately following of the defaulted loan status of a single federal student loan. I reached out to the company Navient in approx XX/XX/XXXX to try and rectify the incorrect reporting but was informed the default status would be upheld and it was my responsibility to inform the Lender of my move. I expressed that I have never had any issues or problems with my lenders at any time and that Id moved several times prior to that move and continued to receive all of my mail because as a responsible adult I ensure 6 months prior to my move I inform the US Post Office to avoid interruption of important mail. I am appalled that this was done to me because I would have ensured other measures for repayment would have been followed just as with my remaining 10-15 federal student loans.

I have spent countless hours with Iowa Student Loan reviewing options, understanding payments and understanding the loans process. I am aware of what I can and can not do and how my decisions will impact my loans and/or my credit. I have also flexed my payments based upon when paychecks are provided ( as do most consumers ). This was NEVER an issue until Aspire got involved. Aspire contacts me, by phone, if my loan is even 5 days past due.

5/9/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Problems will never be resolved in a single call with Discover Student Loans. 

I was given incorrect information regarding deferment/forbearance early on in my loan that caused me to lose several months of my grace period following completion of my undergraduate degree. 

Upon beginning the repayment period, I called on or around XX/XX/XXXX and was told by the representative that the loan servicing provider was in the process of being changed from XXXX XXXX to Discover. I was instructed to call back after XX/XX/XXXX, as nothing could be done with my account until that time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke to XXXX. XXXX stated that the switch had not been completed, and to call back later. Approximately one week later, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called and spoke to XXXX. XXXX suggested that I apply for the repayment assistance program, in addition to advising me that I was eligible to receive a 0.25 % reduction in interest with the election of automatic monthly payments, and that I was eligible to receive my graduation bonus of {$1700.00} to be processed that day and released to my checking account in approximately 4-6 weeks. On XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted the first set of payment relief documentation. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notification that my payment relief  documentation had not been received ; therefore, that same day, I submitted a second set of payment relief documents. On XX/XX/XXXX,  I called and spoke to an unknown representative. This representative stated that the repayment assistance program documents were received ; however, there was a glitch in the system that prohibited the documents from being viewed at this time due to migration errors when switching from XXXX XXXX to Discover. I was instructed to call back at a later date and disregard all notifications received via mail and email regarding the delinquency. During this time, each of my cosigners received a mail notification that the account was delinquent and that it may be adversely reported to the credit bureaus. I called back on XX/XX/XXXX as the online status still states delinquent. The representative stated that the online error in Discover 's system persisted, and to again disregard. I was informed that I was approved for the repayment assistance program and that my new monthly fee for the next 12 months was approximately {$65.00}. On XX/XX/XXXX, I made a payment in the amount of {$70.00}. As of today, XX/XX/XXXX, my account is still showing 53 days delinquent ( Discover reports to credit agencies after 60 days of delinquency ), despite being approved for the repayment assistance program and paying the minimum amount on time. I called and spoke to XXXX, who was not able to connect me with a supervisor. However, she spoke with XXXX ( who is allegedly in charge of the repayment assistance program ) and was informed that I have not yet been approved for this program, and to continue making my minimum monthly payment of approximately {$1000.00}. However, XXXX approved administrative forbearance to be completed by XXXX   XX/XX/XXXX ( unknown length of duration ). 

Because of this "" glitch '' that is occurring with the Discover Student Loans system, I am incurring late fees, my credit report is being adversely impacted, my co-signers credit reports are being negatively affected, and my payments are not being disbursed evenly over all loans ( payment amounts are being credited to interest only on two of the five loans, as the payment amount is incorrectly seen by the system as not being enough to cover the minimum monthly payment ; therefore, the payment is applied incorrectly to only a portion of the loans ' interest ).",,DISCOVER BANK,VA,232XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,5/9/18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2901332

Recently went to submit a full time in school deferment, as I am back in school full time after receiving a degree in order to work on a XXXX and XXXX. A deferment was also sent to the federal loans agency. Navient received my request yet did not send me ANY correspondence on the issue. I was under the assumption that the request would be ok and processed as it had been in the past, according to prior information received from them regarding status as a full time student and being eligible for deferment. In no way shape or form in the past did Navient tell myself via e mail or when speaking over the phone that there was any sort of limitation on full time in-school deferments on payments. My original understanding was that if you were full time, you were eligible. That was it. Navient received the form and request for deferment, let a payment of mine go overdue, and did nothing to contact me or reach out stating that the deferment was not accepted and a payment was overdue. The account just sat with an overdue payment and no action was made to alert myself of either. 

When I finally reached out to Navient I was told that full time in-school deferments were limited to 48 months and that I had exceeded this limit. In no way was I under this impression or had been notified of this in the past, the limit on full-time deferment, and in no way was I ready to make the full payments or had planned to. I 'm not entirely sure I was divulged my full options for repayment and options for help repaying. I still do n't feel as I am. A representative over the phone said that I would need to make payments going forward and my only options for delaying payments would to be apply for three month long deferments and was eligible for a years worth of these. Had no idea that that was a thing and was never notified in the past that this option was available to me. Was also told that i could apply for a forebearance. I am now finding that I may be able to apply for an extended payment plan with lower monthly payments, however this was never offered to myself by any representative or by Navient in any sort of correspondence. I still feel as if I am being misled to options and do n't understand why I would n't be eligible for deferments while a full time student. Navient seems to have a way of receiving correspondence and requests for various things and not reaching out in a manner to let you know their decisions.

"" I recently came across an article written in the XXXX titled "" The Accusations Against Navient '' and my issues is specifically in section # 3 "" Handling Payments Incorrectly. '' I have had an issue with Navient regarding this issue and I would like something done about it. On XX/XX/XXXX, I started making payments on my loans. Since my Subsidized Loan ( current balance {$6300.00} ) is at 0 % interest thanks to the benefits of XXXX Military, I requested my mailed in check payments be allocated to my Unsubsidized loan ( current balance {$13000.00} at 5.75 % ). This was a painstaking experience because each time I had to call and spend a minimum of a half hour talking with a customer service agent to ensure my payments would be allocated solely to the Unsubsidized loan. Fortunately, after each phone call, I was able to get my payments allocated properly. However, starting on XX/XX/XXXX, Navient would no longer allocate my payments to just my Unsubsidized loans stating that I could not do that since it was a consolidated loan. After arguing for some time, I had enough with it and gave up. My question is why could I pay on my Unsubsidized loan only from XX/XX/XXXX, through XX/XX/XXXX, and then not be able to do so starting on XX/XX/XXXX? This is frustrating and I 'd like something done about this. My next step, if not handled properly, is to follow through with media sources and the consumer protection agencies. '' I have created a spreadsheet with all my payments proving my case that I would happily share with you. Thank you for your time and help with this very frustrating issue.

2/6/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I submitted an online application for a student loan consolidation with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Funds were dispersed XX/XX/XXXX to pay off various private student loans. The total amount was {$69000.00}. PRIOR to disbursement of the funds, I was not provided a promissory note, nor was I made aware of the terms of the note, including the interest rate, the manner in which payments would be applied and/or any default terms. In XX/XX/XXXX, Discover Student Loans purchased my loan. 

Around 4-5 years ago, I was curious about how much I had paid on this note and what I had left to pay. I was shocked to discover that of over $ 50K in payments, less than {$2000.00} went towards principal. I started to look into information like where they got the interest rate from, terms of re-payment, etc. I asked repeatedly for a signed promissory note that detailed these items out. They repeatedly told me that they got the interest rate from the promissory note. 

They sent me the application I submitted through XXXX and a generic promissory note that did not have my loan number on it, my name on it, and was dated a full two months prior to me having applied for the loan in the first place. Over the past 12 years, I have paid {$68000.00} towards this note. I was continually threatened with them "" charging off '' the loan, even though they lacked the terms and conditions in a promissory note that would result in a charge off! The continually threatened to default me, even though all I ever asked for was proof that they had the authority to charge the interest rate they were charging and evidence of any type of authority to apply payments as they have. 

I have been exceedingly patient with these people. I have asked repeatedly for documentation regarding the proof or evidence that allows for what they are charging me and I am convinced that they do not have it, and that they are aware that they do not have it. 

I was informed today that my loan "" charged off '', whatever that means. I believe that any negative reporting to the credit bureaus without indicating that this debt is disputed is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I believe that XXXX and Discover both charging the interest that they have and applying payments without the proper authority in a signed promissory note violated the fair debt collection practices act. I sent Discover a demand for settlement XX/XX/XXXX. That settlement demand was denied, but they never gave me the courtesy of a reply to inform me of that.

However, EDFinancial misapplied the payment to my other student loans which I have been repaying over an extended ( 20 year ) period since XXXX. I incurred these loans when I was in grad school.

For security, we log you out if you 're inactive too long and had two buttons, one said yes keep working, the other said log out now. I clicked the one that says keep working, and the page then resets, i lost EVERYthing i was typing, your page is specifically set up to interrupt people while they work and give them two options, BOTH of which will result in losing their work.
PLEASE FIX YOUR page, I helped pay for it- people should n't have to CLICK anything when they ARE OBVIOUSLY TYPING.
For whatever record it matters for, the tech details are irrelevant- this is n't a problem with my browser, it 's not malware, this is a fresh install of XXXX, this was your web page, i looked at some of the code- your page is set up to do this. I can see how this kind of problem would make any percentage of people just give up, not that this particular problem is there to make that happen. THE SAME THING happens to people when they are trying to fill out the Defense to Repayment when the school steals tens of thousands of dollars from taxpayers and then tries to stick part of it to the student, I helped pay for that web page too. A web programmer would have to work hard to leave that kind of silliness in a web page, and there so far are TWO government agencies with this problem, both of which ive tried to fill forms out with, both of which interrupt your typing to make sure you are there and then clear the form. Luckily I was copying text that time, but it didnt matter since months later you had no record of me sending it, the next one got through. *** *** I sent a complaint last year ( XXXX ). Your response did n't address any of my complaints, it seemed to be various information about electronic signatures, but i was n't asking about that. And then you closed the complaint without asking me if it was resolved. I realize you have a lot of work, but I would like to have this complaint addressed in a realistic way- this company has stolen tens of thousands from the US govt, and fraudulently signed me up for loans. After telling her that I couldnt afford to go to this school, the XXXX recruiter rep said that after the GI bill and government grants, there would BE no loans. I was shocked that I could go to this school at no charge. I signed up soon after that ( XX/XX/XXXX I think ). In hindsight, it was the worst decision ive ever made. I didnt sign up for loans through itt, at least not as far as I was led to believe. Ive said this in about every way that I know of, and so far it doesnt seem to matter. A few days after classes started, they interrupted a class to tell me that a mistake was made and I would have to pay them hundreds per month for most of the year to keep going. Hey, mistakes happen, at least thats what I thought at the time. I worked overtime while going full time to pay them their money for most of the year. FT school and OT work, thats really hard, even when the school isnt teaching you much and not delivering on their commitments. They didnt deliver anything close to what they promised- we spent many weeks learning how to turn a computer in and off, how to install programs, very basic troubleshooting. Well look, a school has to start somewhere, all of the students needs to be starting on the same page, understandable. But at some point I lost patience, I complained at first to the school, who always had a variation of the same response, the program ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX at the time ) is new, we are working hard to make improvements, please be patient. Fair enough, for awhile. After 6 months or so it became clear that complaints to the school werent going to help, I started sending letters to the VA, the DOE and others. Eventually it became equally cleat that there was no help there either- every one of my letters was simply ignored. This was probably 8 months into the first year, I was working overtime to pay them their money, I wasnt learning much at school, but we still had a lot to do- I still had a ton of homework, so I was constantly busy, but I started calling the DOE, VA and others, all of them said the same thing- they were sorry but they werent able to take a complaint against a school- I would need to use the schools complaint system to complain, or withdrawal. That system I knew from experience was rigged. Some of the students quit along the way- I fact quite a few of them. We started with 50 people, by the bitter end we only had around 10. All of us talked about options- class action ( impossible because of the contract ), quitting, etc.. Most of us that were left decided by that point we were almost halfway through and the best option seemed to stick it out for the rest of the time, get a degree and just be through with it.
A few weeks after grad I started getting bills for close to $ 20k. As far as I was told, I didnt have any loans at all, in fact I worked my XXXX off while going full time to avoid taking one of their private loans out even. But now it seems another mistake was made, and I owe XXXX XXXX a lot of money.
For years they were fine with me using forbearance. I never knew about IBR- I happened to read about it a few years ago- they never mentioned the IBR to me, and I had called to ask them what my options were several times, not once was there an option to use a payment plan that bills you according to your wages. After reading about it, I tried to ask about it several times- they said that was an option but I would have to show proof of wages and there was a lot of paperwork to fill out. They seemed to discourage it, but both times I talked to them I pressed- I wasnt able to get them to send me what I needed- each time they told me a list of requirements and they would say I need documentation showing my wages, I say I dont have any- Ive been unemployed, and the would just repeat the same thing, you need to show proof of wages But I dont have proof, I am unemployed, Im sorry but you will have to show proof of your income and they just kept repeating the same thing. Anyway, here is part of the current problem- at some point in XX/XX/XXXX they apparently consolidated my loans- I do remember them asking me, in fact whenever I called in they would ask me to consolidate. Here is what I knew at the time- I knew I dont know anything about consolidating. I knew that everyone says you need to avoid consolidating until youve taken the time to understand the options. I knew that XXXX XXXX will say things in a way that makes a bad option look good, and I knew that they would sometimes use the fact that they have thick accents to confuse a situation. So I was very clear every time- thank you but no I dont want to consolidate yet. A few years ago I started seeing that in the paperwork they sent was the word consolidated. And since then ive heard theyve made the same mistake with lots of people. I dont know if it has anything to do with the fact that consolidating loans dissolves any requirement for them to have a valid SIGNED MPN on file. The only MPN they have now is the one generated when they consolidated the loans, And according to all of the info I can find, its not even a valid MPN because they dont have the original, not all of the info is in the MPN, and its not signed by me : 1. Everywhere I look, a MPN isnt valid unless they have the original in their possession. The one they sent me looks like a copy of a copy and its not complete.
2. Also an MPN has to have all of the info filled in and it has to be complete. But the date is cut off, they tell me the date is XX/XX/XXXX, but thats not on the mpn.
3. Also I read that an MPN has to be signed. Apparently an electronic signature must be ok, but I dont agree- what is the point of a signature then? I believe they forced the consolidation because they knew it would dismiss any requirement for them to have the original ( questionable ) MPN on file.
I have no plans on paying for something I never agreed to, to get something that was never delivered.
**I am challenging the authenticity and validity of the MPN. The one they have is not valid and I would like these fraudulent loans to be dismissed, without any requirement on my part to pay taxes on the money they stole from the government. I respectfully request the other points in this complaint addressed in a realistic way**",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WA,986XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/12/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2602512

5/26/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I went to a school called the    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   . Little did we know at the time ( I say we because my dad co-signed the loan ) that the certifications that the school were handing out were not relevant to the industry. The school was intended to provide   licenses    for   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  . As it turns out,   license for   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  is not needed and there was no advantage to gaining a   license for   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  , we were unaware of this at the time. I understand personal responsibility and have paid a school loan for a number of years simply because my dads name was attached to the loan. I realized a few years later that the payments I was making were hardly touching the balance and I could never get any reliable information from the loan provider,  XXXX   XXXX  at the time, to show why my balance appeared to be increasing. I spent some time in the military and my loan was on deferment. After the service I am pursuing my degree and now Navient is telling me that I am not eligible to defer the loan even though I am  a full time student.  Apparently being a private loan does not permit deferment. The company calls me incessantly and is using bully tactics and fear of credit damage to try and force me to pay. My argument is the school should have never been backed by the government to provide loans in the first place. It is obvious there was no real oversight on the part of the Department of Education. The school licensures were phony and the school no longer exists. The actions of    XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX    amount to federally backed robbery. Navient of course will only set tle for 90 %  of the total sum and refuses to negotiate past that point. I would be willing to satisfy some portion of the loan to make this end but I can not handl e 90  % of  XXXX  dollars. Which is almost the original loan amount. My issue is twofold, one being that the payments I was making in the early years of the loan, which would have been {$190.00} per month from around   XX/XX/XXXX  to  XX/XX/XXXX  @   what was supposed to be  a 6  % interest rate, were improperly applied to the loan. I realize the school is being sued for grotesquely poor handing of payees payments. The second issue is the schools unwillingness to defer the loans while I am  in school  and their ridiculous level of harassment concerning repayment. It seems to me they know that they are going to end up losing in court and are doing whatever they can to retrieve as much money from loan participants before that happens. The federal government was conned by the middle-man ( the school ) and the consumer is left holding the bag for the equivalent of an additional car payment every month. I paid faithfully on this loan for  4 or 5 years and owe almo st exactly what the loan was originally worth. I would at the very least like to defer my loans w hile in school,  at the most I would like loan forgiveness for something that has benefited me absolutely nothing. The school should have never had the authority to write or process loans in the first place, especially for a service that requires no training.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,925XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,5/26/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2495044

9/14/16,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"In XXXX XXXX after completing graduate school, I consolidated my federal student loans into XXXX consolidation loans totaling {$34000.00} with XXXX XXXX, which are now serviced by Navient. As soon as I had the income to do so, I made arrangements to make automatic monthly payments well above ( and, if memory serves, nearly double ) the required monthly payment with the excess going towards the principle. By paying {$510.00} each month, as of XXXX XXXX I had paid down the outstanding principle to just {$2500.00}. That 's when Navient decided - without my authorization - to reduce my monthly automatic payment from {$510.00} to just {$30.00} and to extend my repayment term by 9 years to XXXX XXXX. Navient 's notification ( attached ) reads : "" Federal regulations require that the length of the repayment term for the subsidized and unsubsidized portions of your consolidation loan be the same. However, a recent review of your account revealed that the repayment term assigned to each portion of the consolidation loan was different. To correct this, we aligned the repayment terms on your consolidation loan to the maximum term permitted by federal regulations, the largest number of months allowable to pay the loan in full. '' Navient noted that "" If your payment was reduced and you would like to keep your existing payment, please contact us at XXXX. Paying more than your minimum payment will enable you to pay your loan off more quickly. '' No kidding. That 's precisely why I proactively made arrangements to make an automatic monthly payment well above the minimum payment years ago and why I had paid off {$31000.00} of my original principle plus interest. Had Navient not taken it upon itself to reduce my automatic monthly payments and with just five more payments of {$510.00}, all of my student loans would have been paid off by XX/XX/XXXX. Instead Navient asserted some nebulous federal requirement to justify a correction that just so happened to translate into more interest income for Navient and more hassle for me or even worse me paying an additional {$680.00} in interest on {$2500.00} if I did n't get Navient to revert to my prior repayment arrangement. After spending some time navigating Navient 's overly simplistic website to find documents ( only available by linking to the old site ), today I called for an explanation of this change. The representative initially stated that it looked like a request had been made to lower my payment. I clarified that I had not requested any reduction in my automatic monthly payment. He then stated "" we were expecting them to be paid off later. '' Exactly. I was paying my loans off faster than Navient had expected thereby cutting into its expected interest income. By reducing my payment amount and extending my term, I would pay an additional {$680.00} in interest on {$2500.00} ( see attached ) instead of making just five more payments of {$520.00} and paying a few bucks more in interest. The representative was quick to process my request to revert to paying around the same amount ( {$520.00} ). However, the speed with which he happily adjusted my monthly repayment amount combined with his statement about paying my loans off faster than expected, left me with the impression that Navient is counting on its customers not following up about such changes. For me, the difference in the amount and term was dramatic, but I ca n't help wondering how many others have seen their repayment amounts drop ( and repayment terms extended ) without realizing how much more they 'll be paying over the life of the loan. Particularly when couched in terms of a nebulous federal regulation, this seems deceptive. I would like Navient to provide a citation to the federal regulation in its notice and documents showing that the subsidized and unsubsidized portions of my consolidation loan indeed differed as alleged by Navient.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",VA,223XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/14/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2112537

8/27/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"This complaint applies to Navient servicing my private + public loans. These are existing loans in repayment that I used to pay for my education at XXXX. 
I am leaving the country shortly for military activation. For over a month, I 've been trying to get Navient to apply a military deferment to my loans. Despite repeated communications, for the entirety of this time I have been evaded, misled, and outright lied to. As of now, XXXX/XXXX/2015, there is still no deferment on any of my loans. 
My first request was sent in through Navient 's online document system. I uploaded my orders and text stating that I was applying for a deferment. After over a week, I received a series of documents from Navient stating that SCRA benefits had been applied to my account, with no information on deferment. 
I called Navient 's military service line that day. I was told that although they received the orders, they had n't understood them as a request for deferment - apparently, they did not bother reading the clearly stated request sent in with the orders. I was told that if I sent in an email requesting deferment, it would be processed within XXXX business days, maximum. Since my loans were in various states of repayment at this time ( expiring from IBR, coming out of forbearance etc ) I wanted to make sure that Navient 's delays would not punish me with "" missed '' payments or harm my credit. I was assured that when the deferment was applied, my outstanding payments would be folded back into the principal of the appropriate loan and nothing would be delinquent. 
Following that phone request, on XXXX XXXX, I sent in another request per the rep 's instructions, via email. I attached my orders and detailed my request in the email. Over the next week, myself and my co-signor got email notifications about delinquencies on my private loans as I had allegedly missed payments. I called in again to the military service line during this period and was assured that we could ignore those notices and that the deferment would shortly be applied. 
After XXXX business days, there was still no deferment. Navient continued to warn and threaten re : late payments. I called military service on Monday, XXXX XXXX for a XXXX time. I was told that the XXXX business days promise was just an estimate, and it was just taking them longer. 
At this point I was becoming frustrated with the entire process and I noted to the rep that while I had received repeated spoken assurances about the state of my deferment request, I had not received anything in writing backing up that my request was even being considered. This practice is very disturbing to me : Navient has the power to arbitrarily decide that they had never been considering my deferment application in the first place, and all the paperwork would back up their case rather than the truth. 
In response to this concern, the rep assured me that the servicer handling my deferment request would send an email that day verifying that they were in fact processing it. That email never arrived. I then sent an email to Navient detailing my frustrations ; they did not respond. 
During the following day on the XXXX, I received another batch of notifications from Navient, once again stating that SCRA benefits had been applied, with no information about deferment. Again, delinquency and late payment notifications were sent as well. I then called a XXXX time. 
This time I was told that they had messed up internally with the request, had to reprocess it, and now needed a further XXXX business days. I got no answer on why I had n't received the promised email, but I was promised a followup phone call on the status of my loans.

I have a problem with the way they apply my monthly payment. I am a responsible borrower, I am current with my loan, I have no real trouble making my payment. However - I like to pay a little more than the minimum each month in order to pay down the principal. Navient makes it hard, or nearly impossible, to do this. 

The company has an easy way for borrowers to go online to make a payment each month, however there is nothing in the payment process that allows borrowers to repay a little more in order to shorten the term of the loan, and the amount of interest paid. 

Every other type of financing - mortgage, car loan, even a loan I received to buy a new mattress allows for a little overpayment, which is applied to the principal. 

Navient deliberately does not allow this to happen. This is a blatant attempt to XXXX over the borrowers, and drag out the loan term and increase the amount of interest they pay. This is not fair. Many student loan borrowers likely have no idea how to shorten the term of the loan, and Navient capitalizes on this unawareness. 

For many, a student loan is the first type of loan they receive. Assuming they are able to make their monthly payment, Navient traps them with a slick website which tells them exactly how much to pay so that the loan gets paid out over the longest possible period and Navient sucks every penny of interest out of them. Yes, Navient is a business, but they could at least provide a means for their borrowers to pay a little more. This wo n't cost Navient that much, because most people ca n't pay any more than the minimum anyway.

Here is my quick background : I graduated from XXXX school in XXXX XXXX with about XXXX $ in government- owned loans. In XXXX XXXX I was finally able to get hired as a XXXX for a XXXX XXXX XXXX company in Missouri. I have n't consolidated my loans yet and the interest rates varies between 5.6 % to 7.9 %.

I was punished very expensively for not having sufficient funds one time only right from the beginig! Due to confussion, not clear communication and obtaining different answers depending on who was answering the phone, I never knew my exact due date. I was told by different Navient customer service representatives that I had many due dates because I had XXXX loans at that time and each of them had different disbursement dates, so some of them were due in XXXX XXXX, others in XXXX and others in XXXX XXXX. 
I called and tried to explain- but they said the interest rate deduction it 's not a right, but a benefit they provide by using Navient and not other company. 

2. I make XXXX $ / month after taxes. Navient wants me to pay XXXX $ a month as part of the income based repayment plan!!! At this rate, I would be debt free in my XXXX? I called so many times and asked them to please increase my monthly payment to about XXXX $ so that way the money gets distributed over all my XXXX loans including principal not just interest. Of course, I pay extra myself every month but my XXXX, how careless of them to just let people pay the bare minimum necesary and get stuck paying loans for the the rest of our lives. I also need to save for a downpayment on a home. I really hope I 'll be able to get a second loan for my first home.

I filled out the paper form and faxed it in like directed. Again, I waited a week or two and called to check up. Again this form was denied because they needed my tax filings. AND this gentleman told me the online applications worked just fine and did not know why the previous lady had told me that. SO, I faxed in my tax filings. I again, called to follow up. The gentleman said they had everything they needed, but also wanted to inform me my PSLF employment recertification was denied because the city and state was not listed on the form. Again, I was NOT informed of this denial. So I redid that form, sent it in. A day later, my IDR application was AGAIN, denied, because of some silly error on question 4 about whether I was still in forebearance or not. I 'm not sure if I '' m in forebearance or not because it had expired, and I was trying to get my new payment completed so I could begin to pay.

2/22/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I feel that my cosigner and I were duped in to this loan. I would like XXXX to prove ownership of this debt ; I took out this loan with XXXX Bank. I can not file bankruptcy according to the paperwork I received when I ordered a copy of my contract, why? Because this is a XXXX loan, which means nothing to me. If you look up XXXX loan I believe they filed bankruptcy and I have no idea what that has to do with XXXX bank. The document I have states that this is a XXXX loan because it meets the IRS code of a Qualified Education Loan, after all the name of the loan in question is XXXX XXXX, XXXX Loan. I would think that if it is promoted as a legitimate student loan that just as other student loans there would be options available to lower the payments. I have called and asked about refinancing or some of the other programs on the AES website since they are the servicers and been told none of the options are available to me and that I cant refinance. I was also told in a letter on XX/XX/2018 regarding my email at the beginning of XXXX that even though we have made payments on time for over 36 months that I can not remove the cosigner because I used the deferment, well this isnt stated anywhere, and most student loans you can remove the cosigner after 36 months of on time payments. What does deferment have to do with it? 

There are pages missing or fabricated from my loan agreement, the first page which is the signature page is clearly numbered 1 by the fax machine ; none of the further pages have any numbers or information from the fax they could have been changed and added at any time. For example the first two pages have no page numbers except as I mentioned the first page has a fax page number stating this page is 1/8 one of eight, the third page starts with its own numbering which starts at page 2. So there are pages 2, 3, and 4 which look like they can just be added to any loan if a person asks for copies, there are no signatures or initials. Also in reading the court filings regarding AES/PHEA and filed by the CFPB I believe it states that the ( Note Disclosure Statement ) is supposed to be on the first page of which it was not with the documents that I did receive concerning my contract. Another interesting thing is that the beginning page says that it is page 1 of 8 yet when I requested a copy of my agreement I only got 6 pages and a disclosure notice to the cosigner at the end that looked like it had just been added to my paperwork and could have been printed at any time just like half of my agreement. 
I am asking for proof of this loan, it was made with XXXX Bank and is now owned by XXXX and serviced by AES, I have no idea where this loan has been and who actually owns it. I would think that AES collecting on a loan they cant prove ownership of would be fraud and they should give any money paid back to me. 
I have attempted to make payments and stay current with American education services ( my loan servicer for private student loans ) and this loan is to the point where I can no longer manage paying it. I am a XXXX veteran living off of my XXXX pay and my cosigner was medically retired and is now living of social security and they can not afford for me not to pay this loan. The issue is that my actual lender who claims to own the loan is called national collegiate trust. The company buys up old debt and then collects on it, I never actually had a loan with XXXX but they bought my loan. I now have no relief and can not get in touch with anyone at this company. 

AES has been suing individuals who owe them for the past few years and many of these cases have been thrown out because once the case goes to court they can not provide proper proof they actually own the debt, and the borrower case is dismissed in many of these cases. My issue is I have not defaulted to this point, but because of my limited income I have no choice. I just cancelled my Automatic Monthly Payment for XXXX and hope from this complaint I can finally get some relief. National collegiate trust needs to be held accountable and they need to prove they bought my loan. There are thousands of people in my same position just looking to get some assistance and speak with XXXX about their loan and try to lower payments. 

I have never held an account with XXXX XXXX XXXX If XXXX holds paperwork from previous loans, that information should be provided, showing a complete assignment of the debt from the original creditor. XXXX XXXX bought and securitized student loans. These securitized notes were then sold to debt investors. XXXX XXXX then hired collection agencies to pursue debtors for collecting what they considered to be outstanding debts. Federal laws mandate collectors to possess the documents that prove debts they want to collect are indeed owned by the people theyre pursuing. Over 2,000 collections lawsuits that were filed on behalf of the trusts were in violation of the laws. In these lawsuits, the trusts do not have or can not find the documentation necessary to prove either that they own the loans or that the consumer owed the debt. Valid affidavits must be signed by a witness with personal knowledge of the consumers account records. But such affidavits dont exist for any of these lawsuits. 

Employees completed and notarized sworn legal documents for lawsuits brought on behalf of the trusts. XXXX XXXX also filed at least 486 collections lawsuits after the statute of limitations had expired. If there is a class-action lawsuit to help those negatively impacted by XXXX XXXX and its debt collector who sued thousands of students by relying on false or misleading legal documents and couldn't prove that those being sued were the actual owners of the loans in dispute I would like to be included, compensated for damages, and have the following AESXXXX account removed from my credit report : AES/XXXX XXXX XXXX in the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX.",,AES/PHEAA,WA,980XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2/22/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2821204

I 'm not asking for a hand out, I will pay my debts. If I do n't pay -- I 'm at fault. When I 've paid that much toward this loan that only rises ... it 's simply not fair. Imagine if car companies, credit card companies, home lenders were allowed to do this..but for my student loan it 's ok??

40. On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX received a returned payment from Navient of {$96.00}, and was required to make a credit adjustment and return those funds to my account.

41. On or aboutXX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Navient that my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX loans were past due, and that I was required to make a payment of {$380.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. A copy of that letter is attached as Exhibit A 42. I responded to this letter on XX/XX/XXXX and specifically inquired why my loan accounts were not in good standing. A copy of that letter is attached as Exhibit B 43. OnXX/XX/XXXX, Navient specifically informed me that : 44. I have reviewed your account and our records indicate you're not enrolled in our Auto Pay program. If you set up automatic payments with your bank 's bill payment service, please contact your bank to determine why payments have not been made. You-may need to verify that your bank has all of your student loan account information entered correctly. Please know that your account is currently 82 days past due in the amount of {$1100.00}. The next monthly payment of {$380.00} is due on XX/XX/XXXX. Therefore, the total amount due by XX/XX/XXXX, is {$1500.00}. A copy of that letter is attached as Exhibit C 45. On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I viewed the online records provided by my bank ( XXXX XXXX ) to determine whether my loan payment checks were being forwarded to Navient as instructed, and learned that every one of my weekly loan payments was being returned to the bank by the Navient.

46. At no time during the months that I made my loan payments was I informed by Navient that my payments were objectionable in some manner, nor did they explain the reason for the return of the checks.

47. OnXX/XX/XXXX, I wrote another letter to Navient inquiring why my loan payment checks were being denied, and explaining the financial burden those returns placed on me. A copy of that letter is attached as Exhibit D 48. Based on Navients purposeful refusal to honor any of my loan payments, my student loan account has been defaulted.

49. One of Navients primary responsibilities as a student loan servicer is to process payments made on my student loan account.

50. Navient did not have adequate processes and procedures in place to sufficiently address the errors it made in the processing of payments I made, even after I explained the problem and requested help.

51. I did not submit payments through Navients online portal, but instead submitted my payments by mailing a check or through an external bill payment system operated by my bank ( XXXX XXXX   ) where I had a checking account.

52. The payment of the overdue balance at this time would impose a double payment penalty on the me because of Navients actions in purposely refusing to accept my loan payments caused to unwittingly spend funds each week that I believed were in my account to be spent..

53. Because Navient did not make its payment allocation methodologies clear I had no way of knowing in advance how Navient might reject my payments, or know I would end up in default even if I made regular payments.

54. Navients refusal to accept my payments from my bank has resulted in me incurring improper late fees, increased interest charges, the furnishing of inaccurate negative information to consumer reporting agencies, and the loss of certain benefits.

55. As shown by the evidence attached to this complaint and nearly five ( 5 ) years of being ignored, it is clear that the payment processing errors is not an isolated event, but rather that the same payment processing error occurred time and again, even after I contacted Navient to correct the errors.

INTEREST STACKING THRU FORBEARANCE : 56. At the outset of selecting Navient Loan Servicing as my loan service provider, the defendants had a duty to fairly render their service.

57. Instead of doing so, Navients engaged in a structured act of encouraging me to postpone making payments in lieu of coercing me into Forbearance, and failing to provide information concerning other available options.

58. Navient failed to inform me of repayment plan assignment or selection at any time, when I was experiencing financial hardship or distress.

59. Navient has routinely disregarded its own policies and both Federal and Pennsylvania law and instead coerced me into forbearance by submitting cookie-cutter emails which made the option of forbearance a mechanized option, without adequately exploring income-driven repayment plans with me, without even mentioning income-driven repayment plans at all.

60. I was repeatedly sent emails encouraging me to use my mouse and ready-click a few buttons, and enter in deferment on my loans.

61. Navient discussed my loans on several occasions and only discussed forbearance during those phone and calls and from my recollection did not discuss any other payment option besides forbearance.

62. Every instance that I was entered in forbearance was completed over the phone by Navient agents who stressed how quick and easy the process was compared to other options.

63. On a number of occasions, a Navient representative, when informed of my inability to make a payment, directed me into a voluntary forbearance without advice about available income-driven repayment plans. In no instance was I informed that I may have qualified instead for a {$0.00} payment in an income-driven repayment plan at that time.

64. Indeed, only after research forced by Navients refusal to accept my loan payments, did I realize that I may have met the eligibility criteria for income-driven repayment plans, and qualified for a $ 0 monthly payment.

65. My loan balance was also subject to the negative consequences of forbearance, including the addition of interest to the principal balance of the loan, which raised my total loan balance from ( {$43000.00} to {$59000.00} = {$16000.00} [ additional principal ] ), which I could have avoided had I been enrolled in the income-driven repayment plan from the start. A copy of the Loan Documents are attached as Exhibit E 66. Navient also enrolled me in multiple consecutive forbearances, even though I had demonstrated a long-term inability to repay my loans during two periods of unemployment and specifically requested information and assistance.

67. I was enrolled in two or more consecutive forbearances totaling twelve months or longer, and on every occasion it was done via emails or over the phone in minutes.

68. Enrollment in multiple consecutive forbearances imposed a staggering financial cost on me by adding over {$16000.00} dollars of unpaid interest to the principal balance of my loans. If I would have been enrolled in an income-driven repayment plan, I would have avoided these additional charges because the government would have paid the unpaid interest on my subsidized loans in full during the first three years of my consecutive enrollments.

69. If I would have realized that every one of my many loans would take a principle increase when I entered into forbearance, I would have simply paid the loan balance on that particular loan, which could have managed. Below is a copy of the letter sent by Navient after they rejected a number of my payments : Dear XXXX  : This is a very important matter regarding your federal student loan account with the U.S. Department of Education.

You're eligible to resolve your past due payments through forbearance and you may qualify for a new repayment plan.

Income Driven Repayment ( IDR ) plans may reduce your monthly payment and give you more time to pay. Over 50 % of approved IDR plans result in a {$0.00} monthly payment.

Forbearance is a short term solution that will allow you to avoid default and resolve your past due status without having to pay your past due balance immediately.

We have a few options for you to consider : Option 1 : For a long term solution, simply call us toll free at XXXX to discuss all available federal repayment options. You may be eligible for an IDR plan or another plan that may reduce your monthly payment.

Option 2 : Request a Forbearance to bring your account current and postpone your payments for two ( 2 ) months. There is no fee for this forbearance. Read the terms below and, if you want to accept this offer, simply reply "" Yes '' to this message. This is a short term repayment solution.

Forbearance terms : By replying "" yes '' to this email you agree to the following : You request forbearance because you're temporarily unable to make payments due to hardship.

The forbearance will bring your loan ( s ) current and cover your next two ( 2 ) monthly payments.

You promise to repay your loan ( s ) following forbearance according to the terms of your promissory note ( s ).

Unpaid interest will be added to the principal balance of your loan ( s ) at the end of the forbearance, which will increase your total loan cost.

This forbearance does not remove any information previously reported to the consumer reporting agencies.

If you have other federal loans serviced by Navient, forbearance will be applied to all eligible federal loans to bring them current and cover your next two monthly payments. You'll receive a separate notification of the forbearance for each eligible loan.

A notice will be sent to you to confirm your selection and provide you with more detailed information. You will also be sent information regarding additional options such as IDR that provide a long term solution.

70. A copy of this letter is attached as Exhibit F 71. I generally received no response from the letters seeking assistance and information during the course of my loan servicing with Navient.

72. Navients engaged in a structured act of encouraging me to postpone making payments in lieu of Forbearance, and failing to provide information concerning other available options.

73. Long-term enrollment in forbearance dramatically increased the total amount due each month after the forbearance period ended over the repayment term for my federal loans.

74. On a number of occasions, I chose to simply reply Yes to this message., because without information or instruction, I used the most readily suggested ; time-efficient ; and financially feasible method presented.

75. The bank documents from my XXXX XXXX   account show that I submitted the payments and that Navient rejected them because the account was closed or the number was invalid ; however, my account number with Navient is the same as it has been.

76. Moreover, all of the account numbers listed on my payments to Navient correspond with my Navient account number, and therefore there was no basis for them to reject the payments and cause me to spend those funds unknowingly. A copy of the XXXX XXXX payment to Navient is attached as Exhibit G 77. Even after I discovered the matter and asked for help with the matter, Navient rejected several payments and sent emails suggesting that I consider forbearance as an option instead of suggesting some form of assistance with the problem they created.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",PA,17403,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/22/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2851354

In fact, all of my loans had to be cosigned because I had no credit. I spoke with them many many times about this loan and explained that I did not request private loans ever. In 2011, my parents filed for bankruptcy and all of the loans that were cosigned by them, were dismissed in their bankruptcy. I no longer have XXXX loans on my credit because of this. Unknowingly, XXXX more loans appeared on my credit and my mom 's credit recently. When we talked to them about it, Navient told us that they were cosigned by my stepdad, who is deceased, and that they have always been loans with them. To my knowledge, these XXXX loans were not my loans nor were they loans my stepdad cosigned for because they would have been put into his bankruptcy and discharged along with the XXXX loans. These loans are now hurting my credit because I ca n't pay them back. I am a XXXX Veteran and am on a fixed budget. My federal loans have been discharged due to my XXXX and I can not get Navient to forgive these loans. They have continued to rack up interest and shows past due because they will not fix it. According to my report, Navient has reported that the loans have been written off or charged off as bad debt but yet the interest continues to rise and past due amount continues to rise.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",OH,43567,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/26/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1536974

I phoned in and asked the customer service agent if I could pay off one of the loans through them and she said yes. She processed my payment and told me that the loan was paid off. I received a confirmation number and email reflecting that payment. When I went back online to see if my account updated to reflect the pay off. This was not the case, the monies had been spread over all my loans. If the agent does n't have the authority to take a payoff they should not tell the payee this and take the payment online.
I have put in a request to Navient to either put my payment toward the loan that I requested to pay off or refund my monies. I should n't have to ask this. The option should be available already. Every effort should be made to help/allow the student to payoff these loans.
Navient has predatory loan management practices. The site is setup to discourage payoff by requiring mail in of pay off and choosing to only allow the student the option to make a payment ahead and the loan continues to accrue interest. Navient or any other loan servicing agent should NOT be allowed to offer consolidation that requires a student to have to allow them to apply 10 years of interest on the entire loan just to have one loan. This is worse than the housing crisis.
If you have to mail in a payoff, the payee continues to accrue interest on that loan awaiting the payment to be received. The payee should be able to make payoffs online in real time. Why is Navient allowed to not offer payoff online?
Why is the customer service number not located on the front page? why does the payee have to search for a contact number?",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",GA,301XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/19/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2624473
6/9/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"Navient took over my student loan in early  XXXX  ( late   XXXX   ). When they called, they asked that I make a payment at that time. I explained that I was making payments for my school, my daughter 's, and paying on my husband 's tuition. I was granted a deferment for a period of several months.
<P/>
During the process, I kept the representative on the phone for over an hour, asking many questions and verifying that I would not be taken advantage of by this company again. I was even told that the conversation was recorded. I had previously had a bad experience with Navient 's partner and predecessor,   XXXX   XXXX  , who stole several thousand dollars from me, doubled my debt, and sold my account after I proved the theft by providing 20 consecutive checks ( they only asked for 10, but I had several more ).
<P/>
Well before the deferment was up, Navient again contacted me asking for money. When I asked about the deferment, I was told that I only had a 10 day forbearance. I spoke to "" managers '' and other departments who stated that they ONLY give 10 day forbearances. When I argued that they were lying to me and demanded that they play back the recording, I was placed on hold for over half an hour, only for a "" manager '' to return and state that they decided NOT to listen to the recording and that I just needed to pay the extensive late fees. I KNOW they played back the recording and are refusing to admit guilt. At the time fees were over {$200.00}, now they are over {$400.00}. Since then, I have spoken with dozens of managers and contacted the Ombudsman, my congressman, and my governor 's office. All of which have contacted Navient. Navient 's only response has been that they will defer the payments, but they still want the now nearly {$500.00} in late fees. I have not paid them anything because of the late fees and have stated many times on the record that I will pay once they remove the erroneous fees that they charged me. They are clearly refusing to correct the problem by running up the debt with fees, so they can say that I never paid, but paying an erroneous debt is an admission of guilt and will allow them to legally keep the overpayment. This feels like another attempt by the same company to steal money from me.

12/6/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have been paying on my student loans for over 17 years now and there are several discrepancies I have tried to resolve with the loan company, but with no resolution. 

To begin with, the loan was originated in XX/XX/XXXX, with original terms of 240 months repayment ( I wanted 180 months as indicated by my initials on the consolidation note ). At the bottom of the note, the loan official signing the document wrote in terms of 360 months when it is clear the original terms were less than this. The loan balance at the time of the note was {$81000.00} In my last communication with Navient, who now services the loan ( XXXX XXXX was the servicing company prior ), they provided a statement again showing the 360 month term ( which I DID NOT agree to ), saying I have paid 141 months of the note at {$750.00} and 219 months remain. They then go on to say that I have used 43 months of deferment/forebearance during this time WHICH IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. I have used the forbearance option for a month or two hear and there, but absolutely have not deferred the loan for any substantial length of time since I have begun repaying the loan. I have also been repaying the loan with extra money each month for quite some time now totaling {$800.00} a month. Navient also stated that the loan would be paid off in XX/XX/XXXX. Now they have added 4 years on to a note of 360 months that I still did not agree to and is in direct conflict with what is written on the consolidation agreement. 

Over the years I have had these student loans, the servicing company has changed a few times, thus making it difficult to trace payment histories back to the very beginning of the loan. XXXX was the first servicing company followed by XXXX XXXX and now Navient. I have printed copies of much of the payment history and a personal ledger that I have kept since XX/XX/XXXX, showing payment histories and discrepancies between what I have paid and what they are saying I have paid. 

In addition to these issues, there is major concern for the balance of the loan as of today as compared to when it first began in XX/XX/XXXX. As of the day of this letter being written, the loan balance is {$80000.00}. This is {$1700.00} less than the original balance of the loan at the time of consolidation. Where has my money been going for the past 17 years, especially considering I have paid extra for quite some time? I have loan amortization programs available to me showing the balance should be SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than the amount they are showing, if not paid in full by this time, considering the extra funds I have paid each month and the incorrect terms of the original note. There are also two disbursements on the account history provided by Navient in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX of {$4700.00} and {$3000.00}, respectively. I finished XXXX school in XX/XX/XXXX, so why would there be any additional disbursements? 

As you can see, there are NUMEROUS discrepancies in the manner with which these loans have been "" serviced '' over the years. I ask for your help in getting these issues resolved as quickly as possible and an explanation provided as to where my money has been used other than paying down my loan.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CO,801XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/6/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2747306

XXXX XXXX told me that my interest rate would be 'prime plus 1 percent ' which would have been around 7 % at the time. Once I had traveled to AZ and signed a lease for an apartment, the finance department had me sign for the loan which suddenly was 14 %.

Later in XX/XX/XXXX I joined the military and this loan was put into deferment. The loan, and myself moved around a lot.

I have been paying off the loan have it down to XXXX now but recently left the military to pursue college once again with my government benefits. When I started school the bank automatically differed the loan that I had been paying on without any contact to me.

12/6/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Dear Sir or Madam, I am filing this complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau against the loan servicer formerly named ACS Education Services ( recently renamed Conduent Education ) for violations of federal law. 

I registered with then-named ACS Education Services in XXXX XXXX to make payments on a XXXX XXXX XXXX and institutional loan assigned to that loan servicer. I specifically requested that my financial documents, including billing statements, be delivered to me electronically. Although other e-mails from ACS Education were received properly, no billing statements were provided as required by federal law. 

In XXXX XXXX, I received a notice from my educational institution that they were changing to XXXX XXXX as the new loan servicer. I immediately attempted to log in to my ACS Education account to retrieve all records of my payment and balance. However, ACS Education had already blocked me out. 

I attempted to contact them through the web form on their website, which asked for either my account number or the last XXXX of my Social Security number. The web form did not request information as to the type of loan in the account, nor were there different web forms for different types of accounts. The web form rejected my correct ACS Education account number ( provided several times with different formatting ), so I provided my SSN last XXXX. I also provided my full name, telephone number, and e-mail address as required. 

ACS Education responded with an e-mail requesting that I provide the same information that I had already provided, so I did so. ACS Education then sent an e-mail claiming they could not find "" a loan that was ever on [ their ] system. '' At their subsequent request, I informed them that the account consisted of two loans, a XXXX XXXX XXXX and an XXXX loan. Without addressing the institutional loan, ACS Education responded, "" The division that you are contacting does not service XXXX XXXX loans. '' However, as noted earlier, the ACS Education web form did not provide for contacting different  departments. There were no different forms for different departments, nor was information on the type of loan requested. 

After contacting the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was provided a different e-mail address to escalate my issue. I informed that complaint department that the servicer was refusing to help me and was claiming they had no records of my payments and balance history, and received an automated acknowledgment, but never received a response from the complaint department. Subsequently, I received another e-mail from the "" XXXX XXXX '' claiming, "" it appears you initially contacted the wrong department hence why they were unable to assist you. '' The e-mail further directed me to my educational institution, instead of providing me with documents reflecting my balance and transactions with them during their time as my loan servicer. It appears that the former ACS Education, as a business practice, is preventing customers from  selecting a department to contact and then subsequently accusing them of contacting the incorrect department in order to delay customers and avoid revealing that they have destroyed evidence of their acceptance of customers ' prior payments. 

Please help me retrieve records that show my monthly balance, interest, and payments with ACS Education -- not statements from another institution that purport to reflect my monthly balance, interest, and payments. I further request that all penalties for violating federal law be assessed against ACS Education.

My current balance is {$190000.00}, which is an increase from my original loan, even though I have made payments. As of XX/XX/XXXX, I have made 58 payments to NAVIENT totaling {$45000.00}. After 58 payments my balance has not gone down, but up. This did not make sense, until I exported my payment history into a spreadsheet to figure out how this is possible. As I looked at the math on the spreadsheet, it became clear that out of {$45000.00}, only {$8700.00} went towards the principal, {$34000.00} went towards interest, and {$1300.00} went to late fees. The other shady part of this loan is that during the times I asked for student deferral while in class, NAVIENT would not only charge me interest, but also capitalize it. Which really means double dipping. Basically any amount late after 30 days was added back to the principal loan amount. For me thats {$36000.00} that was added back into the loan balance. Remember my paid in amount of {$45000.00} ; {$34000.00} interest and {$1300.00} fees= {$36000.00}? Notice how even though I paid {$36000.00} in interest and fees, they then took almost that same amount {$36000.00} and added that back into the total loan balance. This is the magic behind a balance increase even after 58 payments were made. Basically Im running on a treadmill backwards, if that makes any sense. No lender should be able to do this and especially without informing customers of this practice. Stuff happens and I can understand a late fee here and there, but to turn that late fee into a 120 % win-fall is ridiculous. 

Also I was not in an income driven payment plan from the beginning, I just found out about that on my own, doing research. NAVIENT put me on a payment plan with lower monthly payments, but I would be paying until the year XX/XX/XXXX. I just changed it myself and saved myself 15 years and $ XXXX.

9/30/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't temporarily postpone payments,"I have being dealing with with my student loan deferment since the end of XXXX 2015.I am a XXXX that every year by the month of XXXX I must submit by deferment papers being that Im in a XXXX. This year Navient as denied my deferment due to improper/wrong form filling. Since the XXXX denial due to wrong paper submission I have been calling on a weekly basis to get this matter resolved, being that i work over XXXX hrs a week and I do not want this matter affecting my credit. The first submission was done on XXXX/XXXX/15 and was denied due to improper forms a month later. I then upload the new forms on XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX. After speaking with multiple costumer agents and Supervisors, they inform me those forms were also incorrect and denied. The supervisor informed me that all was needed to resolve the matter was to resubmitted the proper forms, which were email to me by employee XXXX XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15.Once receiving the documents and having both my director from the program fill it out and sign I re-fax the document back to the listed number of XXXX on XXXX/XXXX/15, after a week of no answer or email to let me know the status of my resubmission, I took it upon myself to call on XXXX/XXXX/15 ( as well as re-email supervisor XXXX by email to check the status of my forms and got an auto reply stating he was on vacation from the XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/2015 that if we need any further assistance to contact XXXX XXXX. So we called on XXXX/XXXX/15 to speak with Supervisor XXXX XXXX Employee # XXXX and I was inform that no document were received even though I have proof of fax sent. I also sent a scan copied of the new documents to XXXX XXXX who stated he was also supervisor at Navient ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) on XXXX/XXXX/15.

After multiple submission/scans/email/fax of my deferment request documents I receive email today XXXX/XXXX/15 at XXXX of a XXXX denial stating that wrong/incorrect forms where submitted. With the repeated denial I received an attachment with what they state is the correct form with was the original form that I had my residency director signed on XX/XX/2015 and fax to them 0n XX/XX/2015. At this time my frustration as reach a boiling point because navient bill collectors called me to inform that I was 2 payment behind that with a third nonpayment they would report me to the credit bureau.

It altered my individual perception as someone applying as if I would have known this information upfront in public data on their website or in the material pertaining to discolors and agreements I would not have applied for the loan. This is resulted in a hard credit inquiry on my credit report because of the company 's blatant negligence in giving consumers adequate information pertaining to student loan applications.

The reason I discontinued in auto pay was after they accepted my deferment they then attempted to collect said deferred fees which in turn caused me to over draft with my bank. I filed a complaint with your business at that time and my money was reimbursed. I cancelled all auto enroll payments to Navient to avoid future occurrences. Now, five months later, I had XXXX taken from account today. 
I only work 30 hours a week and can not afford to make any payments at this moment. I reached out to company to request deferment and received a busy signal for number provided on website. I also am unable to defer my loans through the Navient portal. It states that I do not qualify for a deferment of any kind and will only allow me a forbearance. After looking into the the negative aspects that forbearance can do to my financial standing I can not not accept this option.

I then looked at my credit report and began to suspect false information. Prior to checking my credit report, I offered the company Navient a settlement, to which they replied with a bill statement. I then looked at my credit report and began to suspect false information. At that point, I inquired for a validation of debt, communicating concerns. The company replied to me they had done an, "" internal investigation and validated that I in fact owed them alleged amount. '' They did not send me a validation letter as requested. I am concerned that they are illegally collecting a debt from me, as I am a legal resident of the state of XXXX, and understand that in the State of XXXX, debts older than 6-10 years are no longer supposed to impact current credit standing.

7/31/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have a federal consolidated student loan that is serviced by Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency dba XXXX XXXX. The loan was consolidated in XXXX, but XXXX XXXX maintains the consolidated loan as two loan sequences : a subsidized student loan and an unsubsidized student loan. I have been an XXXX XXXX service member in the United States XXXX since XX/XX/XXXX. I am currently under an income driven repayment plan called Revised Pay As You Earn, which was created by federal law. The Department of Education reviews my income on a yearly basis and determines my monthly repayment amount based on my previous year 's income tax returns. I have also been submitting periodic requests to certify the number of qualifying payments that I have made towards a program called Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  Because I am a service member, my interest rate is capped at 6 %, which is a requirement under federal law. I have three main issues with XXXX XXXX, which I have tried unsuccessfully over the last two years to resolve directly with them. 

( 1 ) XXXX XXXX  is miscalculating the amount that I owe on my student loans and overcharging me. Within the last four years I have paid approximately {$53000.00} towards my student loans, however, the total amount that I allegedly owe on the loans has increased approximately {$25000.00}. Approximately {$45000.00} of the amount that I paid was applied directly to the principal of the loans because the Department of the XXXX has made yearly payments on the loans of approximately {$15000.00} per year, which must be applied to the loan principal per XXXX policy. As of 6-months ago, XXXX XXXX XXXX own billing system online indicated that the total amount owed on the loan was {$200000.00}. Now, their billing system states that I owe {$250000.00}. This increase is inexplicable. I have continued to make payments and not requested additional student loans. According to XXXX XXXX, they improperly capitalized the outstanding interest on the loan reasoning that I did not submit my yearly recertification request within a timely fashion, which is incorrect. I attempted to use FederalStudentAid.gov repeatedly to submit the request electronically, then I switched to submitting a paper application that I completed by hand and uploaded to the XXXX XXXX  website. I have evidence of my numerous attempts to submit the yearly recertification application. Therefore, the capitalized interest should be removed. 

( 2 ) XXXX XXXX does not calculate my monthly repayment amount in a timely fashion after I submit my yearly request to recertify under an income-driven repayment plan and places me into forbearance -- or forces me into forbearance -- where I am not able to make qualifying payments towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness and interest is capitalized to my loan principal. In XX/XX/XXXX, I submitted a request to recertify my monthly repayment amount under the Revised Pay As You Earn Plan. XXXX XXXX acknowledge receipt of my application, but -- without my consent -- XXXX XXXX  placed my loan into forbearance while they processed my application. I called XXXX XXXX   and requested that they remove the forbearance so that I could make a qualifying payment for purposes of Public Service Loan Forgiveness. XXXX XXXX indicated that they could not do that for the current billing cycle and I missed the opportunity to make a qualifying payment in XX/XX/XXXX. Then, in XX/XX/XXXX, I again submitted my yearly request to certify my income to determine what my monthly payment amount was under the Revised Pay As You Earn plan. As explained previously, I used StudentAid.gov to submit electronic requests. XXXX XXXX  stated that they did not receive my request, even though I continued to submit it electronically -- at least 5 times. I also received notices from the IRS stating the my XXXX income tax information was provided to XXXX XXXX to calculate my monthly repayment amount. Eventually, it appeared that the electronic system was not working properly. I then uploaded a paper version of the yearly recertification to XXXX XXXX XXXX  website. The loan servicer took several weeks to review my request and then denied it stating that they did not have information about my XXXX income. They then capitalized all of the interest owed on the loan to the principal and increased my monthly repayment amount from {$270.00} to approximately {$2800.00}. They stated that I did not submit my request for yearly recertifying of my eligibility for income-based repayment in a timely fashion -- similar to what they did in XXXX. I resubmitted the form to them electronically and requested to attach my income tax information for my XXXX income taxes from the IRS. I then called XXXX XXXX and they told me that my only option was to place the loan into forbearance so that they can have additional time to calculate my monthly repayment amount under the Revised Pay As You Earn Plan. They read me some disclaimer stating that by placing my loan into forbearance ( so that they have an opportunity to process my income-driven repayment request ) they will capitalize all of the interest to the loan principal. I stated that I did not approve of them capitalizing the interest and that I was disputing the monthly payment amount of {$2800.00}. I am still attempting to resolve this issue with them. They have not processed my pending request to recertify my monthly repayment amount and my account is displaying that it is delinquent. Their servicing issues have been forced upon me and they are attempting to force me to pay more than 10x the amount that I was certified to pay based on my Adjusted Gross Income from XXXX and I have attempted in good faith several times to submit the IDR request to recalculate my monthly repayment amount under the Revised Pay As You Earn Plan. 

( 3 ) XXXX XXXX continues to charge me more than what is authorized by law under the Revised Pay As You Earn plan and the monthly repayment amount calculated by the Department of Education and states that my account is delinquent if I do not pay more per month than my certified monthly repayment amount. In XX/XX/XXXX, the Department of Education calculated my monthly payment to be {$250.00}. I paid this amount in a timely fashion every month. Then. in XX/XX/XXXX, the Department of the XXXX made a payment of approximately {$15000.00}, which brought the principal balance owed under the unsubsidized loan sequence down to XXXX. The unsubsidized loan sequence still had an interest balance of approximately {$700.00}. Once the principal balance of the unsubsidized loan sequence went to XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX  billing system started to stated that I owed more per month than {$250.00}. Every month, I made additional payments to try to get the billing system to correct this error. I also called XXXX XXXX repeatedly and requested that they correct the billing error. Then, in XX/XX/XXXX, the Department of Education calculated my monthly repayment amount again to be {$270.00} per month. I started to then pay this amount, and XXXX XXXX XXXX billing system continued to state that my account was delinquent. I continued calling XXXX XXXX in an attempt to get them to correct my account and reimburse me the overpayments that the system was improperly demanding that I pay. XXXX XXXX failed to correct the issue. I started paying {$280.00} per month because that was the only amount that appeared to maintain my account as current in their billing system -- even though my monthly repayment amount was supposed to be set at {$270.00}. I then submitted a request to certify the number of months that counted towards my 120 payments for purposes of Public Service Loan Forgiveness, and XXXX XXXX  did not include qualifying payments that I made towards the loan because their billing system was not functioning properly.",,AES/PHEAA,NY,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,7/31/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2978694

7/23/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I discovered in XX/XX/XXXX my almost ex-husband had been filing deferments fraudulently since XX/XX/XXXX.  The statements he made included claims I was unemployed which were not true. All correspondence was electronic. I had been lead to believe these loans were close to paid off and only discovered this when collections calls began. I began to pursue a fraud investigation. I requested all correspondence and initially was only given the latest deferment form filed in XX/XX/XXXX. 

I was told in XX/XX/XXXX by the Fraud Department that fraud by a husband was impossible, therefore they would not do anything. Meanwhile, my husband had just been XXXX  for XXXX XXXX for XXXX  use of my credit card and XXXX XXXXXXXX, so I knew this information was not true. I appealed the issue to the ombudsman and requested all correspondence be via email as I felt like I was getting the runaround at best. 

I again supplied the entire history to the ombudsman, I shared personal and embarrassing details of the XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX I suffered at the hands of this man which included being forbidden access to bank accounts, bills and other financial information. I noted that just about everything we owned, to include our home, was in his name only to show evidence of the level of control he wielded. I shared the credit card issue that he paid back to avoid prosecution as evidence of a pattern of behavior. I was asked what remedy I was seeking and honestly felt I was getting somewhere, finally. I shared I wanted relief on the interest as it caused my already outrageous balance of $ XXXX to turn into $ XXXX of debt. I was not asking to be relieved of the entire debt - I would pay what I owed in good faith, I just wanted to be dealt with in equal good faith. 

I was wrong. I got an email that said simply their investigation showed no fraud occurred. I still had not been given the documents I requested and did not get them until I threatened to subpoena them. That threat worked because I got them all -and low and behold, there were errors such as my birthdate being wrong on a form. I hardly think I would get my own birthday wrong, and noted I questioned their investigatory prowess if they investigated the issue at all. I never got a response to noting this colossal error. 

I spoke to another customer service rep to find out what the next level of appeal was and things went from bad to worse. This representative advised me to go back to the original fraud group and submit a document I had not gotten the first time. She also told me not to pay the loans as doing so would indicate my acceptance of them being my debt in their entirety. You are warned all calls are recorded, so this should be on Navients record. 

This information was erroneous and now on top of everything else, my credit has been destroyed. To make matters worse, when I was told through another customer service agent in XX/XX/XXXX that I had been given bad information ( and I started paying the loans immediately upon getting this corrected information ), I was told she would correct the credit report to show I had not been late. I asked if she meant I had been caught up, and I understood her to say no, she would fix the credit reporting and make it good again. This too should be recorded. She also said she would get me in a program that graduated my payments and it would take care of late fees, etc. I kept logging in to pay my account ( there is no way to override their system to pay a lower amount due that I could figure out ) and the payment had not adjusted. I called back and was told the amount was a late fee. When I explained I was told there wouldnt be any late fees due, the agent argued with me and said she did not know why someone would tell me this. Interestingly enough, when I went in to make my payment later, those late fees had been reversed. 

With all of this, Navient has managed to almost double my loan balance by not catching fraudulent activities on my account, refused to really even investigate the issue to resolve, gave me such bad information my credit was ruined and then doubled down on stating they would fix it, but did not. I am not able to indicate I would participate in prosecuting any longer due to the terms of my divorce but would have been more than willing when I started this complaint with Navient. I could not hold out for this issue to remain open as I was being destroyed by him economically as he stopped paying any joint bill we did have leaving me to pay ( which I did trying to keep my credit in tact as he being the awesome human he is, abandoned our children. I am all they have, I needed to stay in a place where I could provide a decent house, little did I know that was for naught as Navient was ruining my credit anyway ). I had also already spent close to $ 50k in legal bills responding to my husbands rediculousness in trying to continue his XXXX  of me by XXXX. I had to settle saying I would assume my student loans and not go after him. Not knowing if I would ever get resolution, I made the best decision I could. But it doesnt erase what happened or how Navient handled this from the beginning. If they had done their due diligence, I could have assisted in prosecution and I wouldnt be facing being a single mother with a XXXX year old ( we were in the process of XXXX, she is XXXX XXXX and we had her since birth, he backed out as another XXXX mechanism and to avoid child support ) and another in college with this crushing debt created through no fault of my own as well as ruined credit that will take years to recover from.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",VA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,7/23/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2970118

Prior to enlisting, I attended XXXX, where I paid for my schooling by taking out student loans. My father had lost his job during XXXX and was XXXX. I could n't believe how easy and quick it was to get a check in the mail from Navient ( XXXX XXXX ). Literally, a six-minute application and a week later, I had instant money. No questions asked. Even though I had no credit history, no employment, and most of the time, no co-signer, Navient threw money at me. I now know this is immoral and predatory. I saw XXXX XXXX as a means of comfort, knowing that I could focus on my education, and even help out my parents at times. I had no idea what I was getting into long term. 

Since joining the XXXX, I have made great headway by saving and paying off large loans, reducing my interest rates with SCRA, and living on a very tight budget. When I got married two years ago, those attempts were compounded, and as a family, we saved and paid off even more debt. To date, we have paid off over {$60000.00} of my original debts. 

My wife 's name is XXXX. XXXX XXXX. She has worked very hard all of her life to become XXXX. She even earned a XXXX at XXXX XXXX. Her first job in our marriage was with a XXXX that we both found XXXX, she also was paid a healthy salary of $ XXXX/year. 

However, due to the uncertainty of our upcoming military move ( XXXX ) and an unforeseen reassignment due to my wife 's medical condition, my wife sacrificed her dream job to follow me. She has since been rehired as a XXXX for XXXX XXXX, dealing with XXXX on a daily basis. Her new salary is less than half of what she originally made. However, this job will end with our XXXX to XXXX XXXX, TX in XXXX 2016. Leaving her with no employment openings or opportunities in her field of expertise. 

XXXX. 

XXXX months after arriving at XXXX XXXX, our current student debt payment ( $ XXXX/month interest-only payments ), will skyrocket to over $ XXXX/month when the interest-only payment schedule ends. Due to my wife 's salary reduction, we have not been able to pay off as much as originally planned. This jump in payment will put us in severe financial hardship. Even if XXXX is able to secure a low-paying job, we will not be able to pay our bills.

I want to serve our country as well as my wife, but this financial situation makes it impossible. I also want to know what my rights are as a U.S. Serviceman, to help stand up against this student loan corporation.

I took out student loans from XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and XXXX for a combined amount of {$21.00}, XXXX. When I joined the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, I sent notice to all my financial lenders a form indicating I was going into XXXX XXXX. I was on XXXX XXXX in the XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I am enclosing the official form ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) as record of the dates. During that time, I was also XXXX to a hostile environment ( XXXX XXXX ) for the dates of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX ( Letter attached ).

With the SCRA laws, my payment were to be deferred 180 days after my separation date of XX/XX/XXXX ( approximately XX/XX/XXXX ). However, in XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from the MN Department of Revenue that they kept my state refund to apply to my debt. I also received a letter in XX/XX/XXXX that the Wisconsin Department of Revenue kept my federal tax refund of {$1000.00} to put towards my debt. This is when I started contacting Great Lakes. 
Great Lakes is claiming they never received notice of XXXX XXXX or the request to reduce interest on my loans. They sent my loans to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX who sent my debt to a collection agency stating I was in default. Numerous phone calls to try to resolve the issue did nothing. They would not accept my XXXX XXXX XXXX and did not want me to send them the forms to show I was on XXXX XXXX. 
I finally wrote to the US House of Representatives for assistance on XX/XX/XXXX. They took my information and paperwork and wrote to the XXXX XXXX XXXX on my behalf. The response from the XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( attached ) indicates they were going to pull my account back from collections, refund my tax refunds, remove my loans from a default status and return the loan to Great Lakes so I may work with them. 
It is now XX/XX/XXXX and of the above actions, the only thing that has happened is the refund of my tax refunds. My credit bureaus are still showing default and the loan has not yet been returned to Great Lakes. This has caused me financial difficulties in trying to apply for other VA loans and get approved. 
My expectation is that my loans reflect the 6 % or lower APR that was to be applied throughout my XXXX XXXX status, deferment that was supposed to take place and the 0 % for the time I was in a hostile environment which was then to be deferred for 60 months. In addition, I want all negative credit bureau reporting of default or collections to be removed and the trade line from the XXXX XXXX XXXX to be deleted since they were sent to them in violation of the SCRA.

9/17/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"Yes, I am following up to a letter that I have received from Congressman XXXX XXXX XXXX office to help me resolve a problem. I have been in an ongoing battle with Wells Fargo Education Financial Services for close to three years concerning a loan that I sincerely believe, that to the best of my honest investigations, I do not owe. I have n't taken out a student since XX/XX/XXXX while I was still attending XXXX XXXX University. I am and have been payingXX/XX/XXXX for my student loans since I came out of bankruptcy in XX/XX/XXXX and I accept the validity of these two loans to be legitimate and I have no problem with this. Wells Fargo, on the other hand, wrote off as "" discharged /closed '' a loan in XX/XX/XXXXright before my bankruptcy took effect inXX/XX/XXXXwhich remains on my credit report with the same status, "" Discharged/Closed. '' Furthermore, I have checked a few times with the Dept. of Education, FASA, and NSLDS and each and every time, I have been given the same answer, which is that I have two student loans and both are held by XXXX. Wells Fargo, has given me the run around so many times and actually changed their story in addition, that I truly and sincerely do not believe in any honest analysis, that I owe them a dime on any loan. I believe they are willingly, deliberately, and illegally billing me for a loan that they already know I do not owe. Is this the same loan that I am paying XXXX for every month?
In addition, they would not send me a single legal document at my request until I consulted with a local attorney and was advised to mention the "" Fair Credit Reporting Act. '' I received one form that they said was a copy of my original promissory note filed. Then they sent me a one page document that was a FEEL loan and they told me that it never goes away. I 'm fully aware of that as long as the loan is legitimate. Finally, then they sent a loan document that stated it was a private consolidation loan, but does n't match the other data. Once again, as I 've told each and every single person who has attempted to help me figure this out, "" If, '' I legally owe this loan, I will willfully pay it until it 's paid off and never complain about it again. I, however, do not believe that I do owe it. I understand that a federal student loan is for the duration until it is paid off or I die.If, however, this is a private consolidation loan, as stated on the last document they sent me, is it still considered a student loan? I fully believe that Wells Fargo intentionally closed the loan to keep from entering into the bankruptcy to avoid bargaining with the Trustee and settling for a lesser amount. They called me almost immediately after my bankruptcy was discharged and were very threatening with what actions they would take if I did n't pay it. In the first conversation held with me, they threatened to garnish my wages at the hospital, have my my drivers license and any professional licenses revoked, and take me to court. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and a XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX  ) and could not have continued working at XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX WA. Are they allowed to just close the loan and then just open it up and come after me as they did? They also told me they were n't allowed to contact me during the bankruptcy and they closed the loan on XX/XX/XXXX, but, as the attached payment record will attest to, they received regular monthly payments throughout the entire bankruptcy from the Trustee. Which is it? When I mention all payments, there were also regular payments made to XXXX and XXXX during and immediately following the bankruptcy until XXXX  acquired my student loans.
I am asking you to please open up an investigation into this matter and help me determine, for sure, if I owe Wells Fargo anything. All forms on my uploads listed as XXXX documents were sent to me directly by XXXX in one large package containing approximately 16-18 documents. I believe almost all of them has Wells Fargo as the former servicer. I hope that I have explained all my concerns and doubts to my best ability possible. I also hope that I have provided you enough documentation to work with to finally and with absolute certainty resolve this dispute in its finality. At some point during this process my loan number was changed to add one more zero at the beginning of the loan number.

First of all In XXXX I entered the military and paid into a school grant which they said we could use anytime when we want to go to school, so I paid into it for a year. A hardship happened and I had to leave the military with an honorable discharge. So I go back to school and ca n't use the money I paid into being in the military so I get a XXXX XXXX loan. Along with the school loan I get a personal loan to cover my books and other incidentals. Push ahead 10 years children, divorce and so and so but I still have to pay off my student loan and I go in default. So years later and my paycheck is garnished and the school loan is paid and I get a letter from my company and Navient a.k.a XXXX XXXX and a.k.a. XXXX saying debt paid and I am released from the garnishment. In XXXX my income taxes are taken because of the private loan Navient says. I filed for bankruptcy in XXXX and add XXXX XXXX, Navient, and XXXX to it because now they want payment for the personal loan I took out. Bankruptcy is finalized in XXXX XXXX and I hear nothing for 6 months all of a sudden I am being garnished again, no letter stating this from Navient or my accounting department at my employer XXXX XXXX. I contact my attorney by phone and email and nothing he has been paid case closed he wants more money that I dont have to correct this mess I am guessing. So I call them directly ( Navient, XXXX ) they ask me to give them proof that the loans were paid by garnishment and that the personal loan was added to the bankruptcy and that I do. I email them the copies that I have sent you. They send back the letter I have attached and now another creditor has purchased the loan from Navient they say, and want money. The next week XXXX is now sending me a letter they want more money. I dont know who to go to about this it can not be lawful. I see that Navient has a class action suit against them. I just need help and I ca n't afford to keep getting attorneys that only want money. Can you please suggest what I should do next I think they will try to take as much money from me knowing that I cant get it back because its the government backing them.

3/5/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I moved my loans from XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX in order to participate in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. At that time, XXXX XXXX XXXX reviewed my XXXX  account history to determine the number of qualifying payments for this program. Twenty-Six of the 36 qualifying payments were credited. I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX upon learning of the 26 qualifying payments to dispute the remaining ten that were not credited. I was told that another review would be conducted to credit the remaining 10 payments and that this review would two to four weeks. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX each month thereafter to check on the status of the review. When I initially called following the XX/XX/XXXXphone call, I was told that there was no determination from the initial review and that the customer service rep I was speaking with at that time would open a new review. This same situation occurred each month I called ; no one could provide me any information about the previous review and a new review was opened with each new phone call. Further, every time I called, the customer service rep treated the issue as if it were brand new ; no one was reviewing my account or the notes from previous phone calls unless I insisted they do so. It In XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a gentlemen named XXXX  who explained the issue with my account was that XXXX had reported my account as having been in an in-school deferment for the period of XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. I explained this was not the case. In XX/XX/XXXX, I returned to school and took out a third loan. XXXX immediately placed all three of my loans in an in-school deferment. I contacted XXXX  in XX/XX/XXXX upon learning about the deferment ( after I had already made my XX/XX/XXXX payment ) to request the deferment be removed from my initial two loans. They removed the deferment effective XX/XX/XXXX. I continued to make the scheduled payments through XX/XX/XXXX when the loans were transferred to XXXX XXXX XXXX. Rick explained that I needed to submit proof of payment for the months of XX/XX/XXXX throughXX/XX/XXXX. He assured all payments would be credited upon another review of the account and that it should take no longer than two to four weeks. I was told he would call me back to follow up with me and let me know the review was complete. I never heard anything.

I have contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX several times since XX/XX/XXXX, almost monthly, to follow up on these ten remaining payments. Each time I have called I was told the review was not complete, but all of the documentation needed had been received. I was told by each customer service rep that they would send a message to the team conducting the review requesting a determination and that someone contact me. Again, I never received a reply.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX to get an update about the ten missing payments. I was informed that XXXX XXXX XXXX was unable to credit the payments as qualifying payments because during the time period in question XXXX had reported my loans as having been in a deferred status. I explained to the customer service rep I spoke to that this was not the case and there were notes in my account that indicated this to be false. I also told him that I had spoke to XXXX in XX/XX/XXXXand had submitted all of the documentation requested to dispute this issue. The gentlemen I spoke to said there was nothing he could do to help me and that I needed to contact XXXX.

I immediately hung up and called XXXX. XXXX   reviewed their records and confirmed that they had in fact placed my account in an in-school deferment ( as described above ) for the period of XX/XX/XXXXthrough XX/XX/XXXX. They also confirmed that the deferment had been removed upon my request on XX/XX/XXXX, to be effective immediately on XX/XX/XXXX. My account was NOT in a deferred status of the period ofXX/XX/XXXXthroughXX/XX/XXXX. The representative at XXXX  also explained that this information had been submitted to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX when the initial loan transfer took place.

After hanging up with XXXX  I called XXXX XXXX XXXX again and asked to talk to a supervisor, per the recommendation of the XXXX   representative who assured me XXXX XXXX XXXX had all the proper records to update my account as I had been requesting. I spoke with XXXX, employee ID XXXX. Upon explaining the situation to XXXX, she was very indifferent to my situation. When I explained I have been calling for a year to try to resolve this issue she repeatedly told me there was nothing she could do about all of the previous phone calls or the promises and assurances made by XXXX XXXX XXXX customer service reps. She further explained that each time a customer calls in, the customer service rep treats the phone call as if the issue is an isolated event and does not routinely check the history of the account or any notes to determine what has already been discussed or the status of any previous reviews. When I explained my frustration with this and that I feel that I have been getting the run around, she told me there was absolutely nothing she could do.

I asked that XXXX review the account, insisting that XXXX had sent the appropriate documentation to XXXX XXXX XXXX to prove I had not been in deferment during the time period in question. XXXX   response was that I need to submit a letter to XXXX XXXX XXXX   requesting the deferment be removed from my account and that all payments for the time period in question be applied to my account. I submitted the requested letter onXX/XX/XXXX.

XXXX also instructed me to submit proof of payment for the time period. I have already done so, twice. XXXX informed me that it would take 7 to 10 days for the deferment to be removed from my account, the bills to be issued for that time period and all payments to be applied accordingly. It would then take another 3 to 6 months for a new review to be conducted to credit the ten missing payments as qualifying payments for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.

After not having heard anything from XXXX XXXX XXXX, I contacted them again in XX/XX/XXXX. I was told at the time that the deferment had been removed as I requested and that the payments for the time period in question were being reviewed and would be applied within a few days. I have repeatedly called XXXX XXXX XXXX  over the past few months ( today is XX/XX/XXXX ) and am told each time that the review is still being conducted. I am told I need to just sit and wait, that there is nothing that can be done. When I asked the representative I was speaking to ( XXXX, employee ID XXXX  ) who I needed to speak to in order to receive a determination about the missing payments, he told me he didnt know. He had no knowledge of who is conducting the review or who I could talk to. He escalated my phone call to XXXX ( employee ID XXXX ) who explained that there is nothing that can be done except to sit and wait for XXXX XXXX XXXX   to complete the review of my account. They are unable to provide a time frame or any kind of guarantee that the payments will be correctly applied to my account. Further, XXXX explained that this is my fault because I was informed in XX/XX/XXXXthat the deferment needed to be removed. This is ABSOLUTELY not true. I was never informed about the issue with the deferment until XX/XX/XXXX, at which time I immediately took action to remedy the situation.

I have done everything I can to ensure that this issue is resolved. I have spent a great deal of time following up with XXXX XXXX XXXX to achieve nothing. I have done my part, I have made my payments. XXXX XXXX XXXX is giving me the run around and refusing to correctly apply the qualifying payments. If these missing payments are not applied, I will be forced to pay them at a monthly payment amount that is more than double the original payment as my income has increased in the time since those payments were initially made. I can not express strongly enough my frustration with this whole process and the lack of concern or care demonstrated by XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have been lied to, misled and my account is being grossly mishandled. I respectfully request assistance from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in having these payments correctly applied to my account.",,AES/PHEAA,AZ,857XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/5/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2833272

I submitted the income driven repayment application on studentloans.gov. My account on studentloans.gov reflects exactly as I remember filling it out and submitting it. I requested to simply update my income and continue the repayment plan I was currently on.

3/20/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX approximately I begin making phone calls to my loan servicer Navient about how to make sure I would qaulify for Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program ( PSLF ). When I would call during those years they would tell me things for example like : We do not have enough information at this time, or all you have to do is simply just keep making your 120 payments on time, and work for a public service employer or a 501 c 3 employer etc. I can also remember calling more than once over the course leading up towards XX/XX/XXXX, checking back up, and each time I was told different things. I would ask, "" Am I under the correct loan type? '' They would never clarify and infact were very dodgy on explaing any facts, nor pursuade me toward any other loans but the current loan I held, nor encourage for me to immediately switch over to XXXX XXXX XXXX at any point. In fact, a person even detered me from changing from the current loan with rationales about interest rates % for not switching and to wait for various reasons etc. 

My loans were held by Navient from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. My loans were finally consolidated to XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to their current status with My Student Loans XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX I called them via phone actually on XX/XX/XXXX and argued with them on the issue. They only credit me with Public Service Credit for 11 months to date. They do not even "" recognize '' the fact that I have worked for 13 years at a Public Service Employer ( XXXX ), Nor even made well over 120 payments of on-time, Income based repayment plan payments ( IBR ) during that period. My employer has sent in verified employment forms to them already of my employment time, history, and required information to them completely! 
Their response to me in the past when I confront the situation to them is that they say, "" They can not acknowledge all my years of public service, or that it will count, because the loan type was incorrect during that period. '' To which I explain to them, "" Why is that my fault, because Navient repeatdly gave false or miseleading information about the PSLF Program? '' In addition to this, the personnel on the phone try to blame the mere fact that the reason this happens is because people did not file an employment verification yearly. This also does not make any sense. This is the latest talking point they try on the phone to borrowers. It is clear that when your employer certifies your employment that they know you have worked there for 10 years or longer and made 120 payments while working there with the public employer. This is not the first time I have called them before obviously, they have used the loan type senario argument as the basis for denial of not giving me my forgiveness of student loans. Before, they always have used, the excuse of the wrong loan type. Then they simply defer to the department of education, and say, "" Sorry you'll have to work another 10 years there, and make another 120 payments and start all over again! '' Navient never was forth right in the information, and never made clear to me at all between XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX information regarding eligibility for the PSLF, nor did they forth rightly do so after the period of XX/XX/XXXX when finally formal forms, and information was being handed down from the federal department of education afterwards long over due. 
I communicated, and made voluntary phone calls to Navient on this matter over the years trying to stay abreast of the situation and each time I was ill informed, misguided, and now I am in the situation I am in today as a result of it. The current lender refuses to understand, nor acknowledges all years of time with my current public service employer, or the good faith payments under the program through one technicality or another. 
Why must dedicated public service workers pay the price for lenders who failed to properly administor information on eligibility, or give false information and leave workers and loan repayers in this type of situation? 
I seek a remedy, and a solution to this situation. This can't be what this spirit of this program intended back in XX/XX/XXXX.

10/28/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"In XXXX XXXX, I co-signed a {$20000.00} Sallie Mae student loan for a friend who was attending XXXX University. We filled out the application online, but when we hit submit, the page gave us an error message and said our application was not submitted. The next day, we went back to the website and filled out the application again. The application was properly submitted. We thought we were only applying for one {$20000.00} loan, but apparently the first loan actually did go through and Sallie Mae dispersed two {$20000.00} payments to XXXX University. My friend had a balance on his student account for approximately {$10000.00} at that time. He called and physically went to the XXXX University Financial Aid Office multiple times to make sure they would return the first {$20000.00} loan and the remainder of the second loan ( after his account balance was paid off ) to Sallie Mae. He never received a check or payment of any kind from XXXX University. The student loan has been in deferment this entire time because my friend was attending school full time. My friend and I stopped talking around XXXX XXXX due to a completely unrelated issue and I have not spoken to him since then. 

Fast forward to XXXX XXXX, when I received a notification from my credit monitoring company that a Sallie Mae student loan I had co-signed for was 30, 60, or 90 days late. I logged into the Sallie Mae website and discovered both {$20000.00} loans are still due and no payments had been made on either account. I called Sallie Mae and explained what had happened and they transferred me to the Fraud Department. The person I spoke with looked at the original applications and said there was definitely an error since both applications were for the same type of loan, same amount, and submitted within 24 hours of each other, but he said since the loans had already been dispersed to XXXX University, I needed to talk to the University to resolve the issue. He told me to email XXXXXXXXXXXX and ask them to return the unused portion of the student loans to Sallie Mae.

Today ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, I called the Bursar Office once more to get an update, and the lady I spoke with told me no one would be calling me back or speaking to me about the issue because I was not the student and it was against federal law to give information about student accounts to someone other than the student. I explained I was the co-signer of the loan and no one has been able to get a hold of the student ( it appears he lost his job, changed his phone numbers, and had his condo foreclosed on and has not responded to dozens of phone calls, messages, or emails from me, my family, or Sallie Mae XXXX, but the lady told me it did n't matter, the only person who could request an investigation into the matter is the student.

The loan has been on an IBR payment plan for several years, but on XX/XX/XXXX I called Navient to inquire about lower monthly payments. I was told that switching to a  graduated payment plan would reduce my monthly payment to around {$40.00}, so I agreed to switch. I was then told in order to switch payment plans they have to apply a 1 month forbearance, so I agreed. 

A few days later I received several emailed letters. One email showed a higher payment amount than I was originally told and another email stated that a reduced interest rate incentive will be removed from my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Navient to inquire on these letters and was told that the once they processed the new payment plan that the payment went up because my loan term was shorter than previously thought. I was also told that the reduce interest rate incentive was removed because of the forbearance, but would be reinstated once the forbearance ended and I was placed on the new payment plan. 

After 2 payments on the new payment plan I noticed that the interest rate was still not reduced, so on XX/XX/XXXX I called Navient a third time. This time I was told that the interest rate reduction incentive can not be reinstated because it was a 'voluntary forbearance ' not an 'administrative forbearance '. 

Again, I never wanted the forbearance, but was told I had to do the forbearance in order to switch payment plans, I was given no other option other than the forbearance, and I was never told I would lose the interest rate reduction. Had I been told any of that, or that the actual payment would be twice as much, I would not have switched the payment plan.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,34233,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/12/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2753551

The problem is that the Department of Education through FedLoan Servicing have disregarded 17 years of payments that I the Department of Education received. Let me explain ; my student loans defaulted about 20 years ago when the Department of Education defaulted me without notice and without serving me with a complaint. Their excuse was that they could locate me but that is inaccurate as each time that I moved, I filed a change of address with the United States Postal Service. Be that as it may, my loans defaulted and I entered into a payment arrangement with the XXXX XXXX XXXX, a collection agent for the Department of Education, and {$170.00} per month was taken out of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX checking accounts for over 16 years.

In spite of these monies having been taken from me for over 18 years, my student loan account has not been credited with the amount being applied to my student loan debt.

I was told that there was a merge between accounts and that balances may be incorrect. That message was also posted on their website very briefly.

I was advised to submit additional receipts that were not accounted for online, but they have not been acknowledged.

It is concerning that I am being told any payment that has been intercepted reflects on my online account payment history, but I have in fact given proof that they have not been accounted for.

I believe that this is discover student loans fault, and their consumers should not have to suffer due to their unorganized merge.

I have also requested a thorough payment history breakdown from the beginning of the loan history, disbursements, and payments made. I was told one would be given to me, and I have still not received it. It has been well over a month now.

This is the first communication I received since graduation about this loan. When I graduated, my loan was being held by Campus Partners, which was being purchased at the time. I created an account with Campus Partners, to pay my loan. However, they did not allow anyone to begin repayment of their loans, due to their company being purchased by another. Therefore, I was unable to pay my loan. Now since my loan is in default, they want me to pay the interest on the loan plus the principle amount. I was more than willing to pay my loans, which would have been without interest at the time. I immediately contacted XXXX, after receipt of the letter, to try to figure out how my loan became in default. They said that I needed to talk to the company ( ECSI ) who now owns my loan. Therefore I contacted ECSI by phone. When I finally was able to speak to someone, they were extremely unhelpful, and before even getting to the reason for my call, they hung up on me. Since I never got any information from them by phone, I looked for another method. They had an online chat available, so I tried chatting with them. 
From this, they said that they were sending me information, but it was all being sent back ( because they were sending it to my address without sending it to my apartment ). I questioned them on why they had the wrong address, and they said it was given to them by Campus Partners. Then I asked why they did n't contact me by phone or email? They replied that it was against my schools policy. I never got to ask why they did n't just contact my school to request my address. However, they said there is nothing they can do and I just have to pay the loan and the interest that accrued. I told them that I would be more than willing to pay my loan minus the interest, since that is what would be fair, this being the first contact I received. However they said that I needed to pay the interest as well. So I asked to talk to someone who could help me straighten this situation out. They referred me back to my school. So I contacted my school by phone and email. They said they would look into it. I just received an email today from XXXX stating that there is nothing they can do, and I just have to pay the loan plus this accrued interest.

I have attempted to change my due date twice over the past 6 months and have been denied under the grounds that a borrower under the Income Driven Repayment Plan can not request a new due date until they re-certify the following year. I have been unable to find this stated anywhere on the FedLoan Servicing website, nor was it stated in the document that was sent to me titled "" Information Regarding Your Student Loan. '' I have requested on multiple occasions via telephone that the information regarding the denial of due date change based on my current payment plan be provided in writing, but FedLoan Servicing has failed to provide this to me in a timely manner. I am due to re-certify my loans next month, and I am not confident in FedLoan Service 's ability to complete my application and request for a new due date properly. Below is the information from the Frequently asked question section of the FedLoan Servicing Website regarding the question "" Can I change my due date? '' -- As the FedLoan website states "" You can change your due date if your account is not past due. However, we can not change your due date before you make at least one payment toward your loans. If you are entering repayment for the first time, please make your first payment as scheduled before requesting a new due date. '' -- - I feel that FedLoan Servicing is misleading its borrowers and I request that they provide me with all the necessary supporting information and obvious limitations of the Income Driven Plan that I am currently enrolled in.",,AES/PHEAA,AR,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/6/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2238201

12/1/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"***This is a resubmittal for complaint number XXXX ***Last complaint was sent back due to "" Unauthorized third party '' **** Originally I was put on a Graduated Repayment ( i believe in either XXXX or XXXX ) for {$130.00} and paid that without missing anything. When I was told in XXXX XXXX that this would be changing I applied for Income Based Repayment via the student loans.gov website. The first time i applied was XXXX XXXX, XXXX. The application is still pending on the site because it said I needed my wife 's tax returns. I figured this was a mistake because I thought I applied for "" Married but filing separately '' so i applied again on XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Same scenario, I heard nothing from the website and that application is still pending on that website to this day. Sometime between XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, XXXX I filed another 2 applications before finally calling Navient and trying to get squared away. During this phone call I was told all I needed to upload were most recent check stubs, which I did. For some reason I can not find these on the Navient website. During all of this, I 'm seeing that my monthly payments were varied as high as $ 400+ to {$280.00} and having no idea what to pay so I waited, against my better judgement. During the phone calls I specifically asked if while I was waiting for a response if missing the payments would affect me and was told no. In XXXX i started receiving delinquency notices, the phone calls started, and finally in XXXX my credit score dropped over 150 points. So i drafted a letter to Navient explaining that I was still waiting for them to contact me about IBR and if I did n't here from them, I would seek advice from a lawyer and file complaints. Which brings us to today. What I did to mitigate the missed payments since I never had a true total monthly payment amount was add the original {$130.00} over 4 deliquent months and added the accumulated late fees which came to a total of {$540.00}. I spread this total over the loans proportionally to the amount of the individual loan. Shortly after I made the payment and wrote the letter about seeking a lawyer and filing a complaint, I received this from Navient : "" Thank you for contacting us in regards to your request for an Income Driven Repayment plan. I can certainly understand your concerns and will be happy to assist you with your inquiry. I apologize for any inconvenience this matter has caused you and hope the following information is helpful and alleviates your concerns. Your request for an Income Driven Repayment plan was approved and your total payment amount was calculated at {$240.00} effective XXXX XXXX, XXXX. Disclosure Notices with your payment amounts and effective dates were sent via email. Please allow 24 to 48 hours for delivery. Please note that although your scheduled payment amount is {$240.00}, the present amount due on XXXX XXXX, XXXX, is {$56.00} due to extra funds previously received. An administrative forbearance was processed to bring your account current. '' While I am glad I finally got an answer from them, I find this to be less than sufficient for more than a few reasons : 1. The amount is too much for me to pay ... my income has n't changed so why should the payments? I had a stellar track record of on time payments as well. 2. I sure do n't want a forbearance for the missed time because I feel like i made more than an enough effort to continue with on time payments. 4 application attempts, phone calls, emails, and the {$540.00} payments including fees to cover loss time. Side note : Almost all of that {$540.00} went to the interest of each individual loan. I would like that to be fixed as well. 3. My credit score. This was the most upsetting for me because I took great effort to climb out of that hole over the years, and making years of faithful payments was the main reason for climbing out of that hole. My goal here is to get back on track with the loans. I would like to get as close to the {$130.00} payment as possible since my income has not changed, i would like the {$540.00} to allocated accordingly over each individual loans ' principal/interest/late fees, even if my math was wrong I and willing to make up the difference so far as how its allocated is done properly, finally I would like my credit score fixed.

I have attached the following documentation for review Letter and Loan Rehabilitation dated XX/XX/2018 appealing for hearing by phone which I never received, and I sent all documentation ( letter attached ) Letter from ACT on Federal Student loan letterhead denying my request dated XX/XX/2018 Letter, and Loan Rehabilitation to ACT dated XX/XX/2018 appealing again for a hearing in person, and I again submitted all documentation.

Please see documentation attached showing {$4700.00} payment received by ACT crediting at a rate of 75 % toward interest. A letter I received from ACT dated XX/XX/18 indicating interest was supposed to be at 4.133.63 %, and the amount of {$160.00} toward the principle is not calculating interest at 4.133.63. These high interest payments are against the usury laws, and this practice of charging high interest rates and fees at absorbed amounts should not be allowed. 

I borrowed only approx. 21,000.00 from the Federal Student Loan Department, and I have received a letter dated XX/XX/18 stating I owe XXXX and XXXX dated XX/XX/18 stating I owe XXXX, XXXX. I have requested explanation for the over {$10000.00} different, and have received only federal codes from Account Control Technology that these fees are allowed to charge at this amount. I would like to have the actually meaning of all the federal codes, along with the rights to me as the borrowing the proper appeal process beside stating if I do not like it I can sue in Federal Court as mention in the letter dated XX/XX/2018 from Account Control Technology.

I have been threatened by ACT when requesting hardship hearing ( Rehabilitation Loan ), if I do not like their decision I can sue them in Federal Court which is a terrible way to treat a person, a consumer which is only trying to get help per Federal guidelines. I file a complain directly with Federal Student on XX/XX/2018 reference the threat, and I was not given full credit of all monthly payments. I was told by the Federal Student Loan department when speaking with a supervisor only to refile again ( please see letter dated XX/XX/18 ). If I was given full credit for all my monthly payments, and my mortgage was taken into consideration in the amount of {$1500.00}, this could have affected the outcome of ACT decision no tot grant my hardship request. I feel this was a deliberate done on ACT part in order to not grant the garnishment request. I was not granted the phone hearing requested in the first appeal on XX/XX/2018, and I was advised by supervisor at the Federal Student Loan number name XXXX to resubmit the request again. I sent another request on XX/XX/18, requesting a in person hearing along with all documentation, and as of today no respond from Account Control Technology. 

































































The garnishment has been a serve hardship to my family, and I am only requesting a lower payment amount. I have borrowed funds from family to help with my monthly payment due to the garnishment has left me in a financial hardship. Act Control Technology practice is inexcusable and should not be allowed, requesting the necessary hearing, Rehabilitation Loan, and following the procedure have left me to no avail with ACT. I supply documentation and they claim they are not there, calls go unanswered, and letters is returned from ACT is standard and they do not answer any question. I am appealing for help and any intervention you may provide in this matter.

She then proceeded to inform me that my total loan amount had jumped up to {$69000.00} in six month 's time. I told her that this must be a discrepancy and she said that it was not, and in fact, was compound interest of exactly {$24000.00} in that 6 month duration. I went onto the XXXX site to look over my loans and saw that it appeared to be a duplicate entry as the total owed amount is exactly the same on both lines. XXXX put me on hold so she could speak to her supervisor and then came back and said that the amounts were correct and that it was compound interest. I explained to her that there is no way I could have accrued that much interest in 6 months and why wasn't this told to me if that was the case?

3/28/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Getting a loan,Qualify for a better loan than offered,"{$12000.00} For ONE Year of College In 2007, I was a XXXX with my sights set on college - and only {$20000.00} standing in my way. I received a colorful advertisement in the mail from Chase Education Loans promising the bright future I was so desperately seeking, and snagged the opportunity immediately. Sure, I read the fine print - but at XXXX, I did n't quite understand the meaning behind "" variable interest rates '' and signing away my soul. I wanted to go to college, and Chase offered the solution. Problem solved! 

During my first month at school, I received a piece of mail from Chase - my first piece of mail addressed to my dorm! I opened it up, and sat down in shock as I read the numbers printed on the paper - My {$20000.00} loan was in deferment until I graduated, but would continue to accrue interest during that time period. Over 30 years, I would end up paying {$100000.00} in interest - that 's a grand total of {$120000.00} for my XXXX year of college. 

Once I 'd obtained my XXXX and my loan came out of deferment, I was sent a bill with a whopping total of {$34000.00} to start paying on - and a minimum monthly payment of {$330.00}. Out of that {$330.00}, only {$30.00} goes towards the principal of the loan - meaning I 'm paying {$300.00} a month in interest. 

Drowning seems to be the only way to describe how I feel when faced with the reality of my situation - although helpless, ashamed, and depressed are right up there as well. After 3 years of making payments on this loan, I have n't even scratched the surface - my statement this month says I still owe {$34000.00}. The total has n't gone down despite paying every month, it 's gone up! 

I 've tried educational counselors, financial advisors, loan forgiveness programs ( unavailable to private loan occupants ), renegotiating the terms of my loan with Chase - you name it, I 've tried it. I feel desperate and frustrated all at the same time ; I went to school to provide a better future for myself and my family, and yet I 've put myself into a predicament that I ca n't seem to climb out of. I 'm desperately trying to make something of myself, and yet my student loan for ONE year of college is truly making it impossible for me to move forward! 

Times are tough for everyone - in a struggling economy, we 're all just trying to make it from paycheck to paycheck. My goals in life, however, are stymied by the weight of the decision I made at XXXX - the decision to believe and trust in a company as prosperous as Chase so that I could go to college and accomplish my dream of a degree. 

Thank you for reading my story - and hopefully learning from my mistake!

They refused to even talk about an income based option or ANY other option I have available besides setting me on automatic payments. It was either I pay the full amount, my co-signer pays the full amount, or I default on the loan.

When I was in college my legal name was XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. I changed it legally on XX/XX/2013 to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. This will explain the slight difference you'll see. 

I need to have the unfounded student loan debt wiped out and I need for NAVIENT to correct the debt on my credit report immediately. 

As I stated on our call earlier today, NAVIENT is reporting this debt as {$54000.00} to all three credit bureaus ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) making it look as though I had a {$30000.00} loan and I went over the balance by {$24000.00} this is a 185 % debt to credit ratio and has been hurting my credit for years. 

I'd like for ... Navient Student Loan Services to ...

1. Provide copies of all student loan agreements/contracts that they say I signed for a total of {$30000.00} 2. I'd like for the true amounts to be recalculated and interest on the new balance corrected for the past 26 years 3. I'd like for my credit reports to reflect all true and factual numbers 4. I'd like for my credit report to reflect the true balance of the actual loan amounts they say I owe to all credit bureaus 5. I'd like for my credit report to reflect the interest as part of the balance and not reflect that I went over the balance by {$24000.00} as it does now. 

Keep in mind that i have hired an attorney to try and get them to do the right thing and they did not provide proof to us about loan amounts, nor did they correct the reporting on my credit reports.

I had thought it was XXXX handling these loans, but my financial advisor has corrected me and told me this problem happened with Fed Loans. I tried to go back in to my old complaint and apologize to XXXX, but there does n't seem to be a way to do that. Thank you. 

Complaint : 1. A while back it was brought to my attention that there were multiple instances of bad marks on my credit report from student loans in default. This surprised me, because I was not aware of any default, and believed that I was in deferment, and had not been called or received correspondence from the loan servicing company. 2. I then called the loan servicing company. I was then further shocked to find that they had in my file very old contact information, an old address in XXXX, Missouri, and an old landline phone number from the days before I had a cell phone. This was quite strange, since I 've had a the same cell phone number since XX/XX/XXXX, and it 's the number I had when I took out new loans for the graduate program at XXXX XXXX XXXX I entered in XX/XX/XXXX, which I knew they had. 3. I pressed the phone rep at the loan servicing company about this, and finally asked to speak with a supervisor. The supervisor looked in to it and said that when my deferment was ending they -- for reasons they could not explain -- contacted one of the references I 'd included on a very old load request ( it must have been from an earlier degree program ) and that person had provided the old contact info, since it was the last contact info she had for me. I asked them who they got that contact info from, what was the person 's name? And they told me : XXXX XXXX. XXXX is an old friend from a place I had n't lived since XX/XX/XXXX, and whom I really had n't had much contact with for years, so she had very old contact info for me. The supervisor stated that XXXX had given the worker that info, and then that the worker had improperly deleted the other contact info -- which was the CORRECT info, at least the phone number, since, as I said above, that number had n't changed since XX/XX/XXXX ( still has n't changed ). I then asked if they had n't noticed that mailed correspondence to me at that old address had been returned, and the supervisor said that federal mail can not by law be returned, it would have been discarded, and so, no, they would n't have see that was n't a good address. Again, the supervisor stated that the worker should not have deleted the contact info they had for me, even if he was going to enter the incorrect information received from XXXX XXXX. 4. I  then asked the supervisor to put my current information back in the system, and he agreed to do that. 5. I then also asked the supervisor to have the hits on my credit report removed, since the loan going into default in the first place had been their fault, since the deletion of my current contact phone number had been improper, and he agreed to do so. 6. Now, as I work with a financial advisor at my local credit union to try to buy a house with my veteran 's benefit ( I am a XXXX XXXX Veteran ), we find that there are multiple, something like 12 (! ) bad hits on my credit report, all apparently stemming from this event of the improper deletion of my correct contact info. 7. I have been making payments on my loan since that time. 8. Can you please help me in getting those bad, erroneously acquired marks from my credit report? So that I, a veteran, can buy a home?

I was instructed to take the original loan amount and manually go through the transactions line by line ( from origination date in 2007 to present ). 
The practice of refusing to show a running balance due per transaction hurts consumers, and can esily lead to unscrupulous or abusive practices, as the consumer is essentially 'flying blind ' on the total due per each transaction.

Ive submitted several complaints through their ombudsman and advocate office, as well as three CFPB complaints. One of the cases ( XXXX ) was documented as duplicate. None of my complaints have been resolved yet theyve been marked as closed. Part of my last complaint was regarding a fraudulent loan. While Im fighting the fraud issue, Im still trying to keep the loan from becoming increasingly delinquent. Upon submitting financial information for myself and my mother who is the co-signer, I was placed in a payment program. In the first three months of the program, I had to submit another complaint due to a manager deciding I was no longer eligible for the program, regardless of my XXXX status. The advocates office got involved again. They discontinued the payments and placed my accounts in an administrative hold status. While I was working on the medical documentation required for my XXXX request, my mother received a call from Navient about the loan defaulting. I called the person back and he stated one of the loans had now defaulted due to no payments being made and its been reported to the credit bureaus as a charge off. I made it explicitly clear this information was not accurate. After ending the call I reached out to the advocates office to find out what was happening as none of this made any sense. Approximately 2 weeks later, I was informed that the loan is now in the Navient recovery office for default but that a payment arrangement could be made and the interest reduced to nearly 0 %. Ive reached out to this recovery office but have yet to speak to the person who is said to be the account manager. This cant be legal. This account had three payments made, via the required ACH process. The loan was then on an administrative hold. So I dont understand how they are now able to say no payments were ever made and have subsequently charged the loan off.

Its also the same loan Ive submitted complaints to your office about, including written and voice-recorded documentation.

I was n't taught much about college where I grew up. I joined the XXXX when I was XXXX. I realized when I was XXXX that I could actually go to college and growing up less fortunate and in poverty does n't exclude you from college. That was about all I knew. I was still learning how to maintain my finances and everything else adult like. 
When I started looking for colleges I did n't know much about accreditations, etc. I ended up signing up for an expensive school that was for profit. They did their best to push loan after loan on me, then eventually hit me with the, "" You ca n't afford school anymore and ca n't get more loans. Can you ask a family member? '' I asked my brother to cosign for me ONLY so I could continue with my schooling to hopefully make something of myself someday. Well years later my interest rates have gone from 1 % to about 9 % and I am in and out of school so these loans hit my credit whenever I am out for a month or more. Each time they drop my credit score drastically, which I am trying to fix ( post bankruptcy ). So this kills my chances of ever being a contributor to my economy, it prevents me from EVER being a homeowner. I ca n't afford to pay the loans as I have more than one, plus I was trying to finish school before paying them off. With my interest going up 8+ % it makes even harder to pay. If I could get my credit up I could refinance and or consolidate, but at this rate I will never be a homeowner. School is meant to be a precursor to the American dream, but our country has turned it into the American Nightmare. 
Granted, I could do better with my finances, but school payments come and go as I am in and out of school. 

My main issue is, why is something that is supposed to go towards improving your life, so often making my life far more difficult. I have been close to having a high enough credit to purchase a home, then school loans hit me. These CAN NOT be claimed on bankruptcy, they are n't good rates anymore. WHY CAN THEY AFFECT MY CREDIT SCORES? They do n't help my credit scores if I pay, but they can sure XXXX hurt them. This does not only apply to me, but also to my brother who was unlucky enough to co-sign for me. 
Our credit system is not in place to help the consumer, it is ONLY in place to help businesses and its complete and utter garbage. If you could fix our credit system and student loans the country would be better off. I am still waiting for something to be pushed through congress to claim school loans on bankruptcy because this is XXXX! My life is being made harder by going through college. 


Please stop allowing school loans to detriment my credit scores. It makes me want to never pay them as what is the benefit if they keep me from purchasing a house my whole XXXX life! And I am expected to pay them for 30 years at affordable rates?!!!!?!??!?!?!

These are the same offenses for which they are currently being sued by CFPB ; failing to work with students having problems paying their loans, failing to apprise borrowers of available options, including income based payments ; and, steering students to forebearance as opposed to other options. 

Navient reported negative information to the credit bureaus stating that I was 60 days delinquent paying my student loan. They did this in an attempt to bully me into paying my nieces student loan, rather than work with my niece by temporarily reducing her monthly payments to an amount that she is currently able to afford. Ignoring my nieces repeated requests, Navient instead began harassing me and demanding that I begin making the payments. Although my niece was experiencing temporary financial issues, she was still willing to pay reduced payments to Navient until she was able to make her normal payments. Navient repeatedly refused my nieces request and demanded that I begin making the payments to the loan. In an attempt to get me to begin paying my nieces monthly payments, Navient was rude, disrespectful and resorted to bullying and threats of filing adverse information in my credit report.

XXXX  began garnishing my wages without providing me with proper notice prior to the garnishment which prevented me from exercising my right to file an objection. I was told about the garnishment by my former employer and was not notified by XXXX. 

More than 15 % was garnished from my paycheck which caused major hardship on my family. My hardship was shared and discussed with a XXXX representative and fell on death ears. I had several conversations with XXXX and told them numerous times that the garnishment was affecting my ability to care for my family and requested to enroll into income driven programs. I was told, by a XXXX representative, that after making 6 payments of basically $ 500- {$600.00} per month I could qualify for lower payments of {$5.00} per month. How does one afford to make those types of payments if I demonstrated my inability to make those payments. 

Further, after discussing this with the representative I figured out she never had any intention of enrolling me into any program, but instead would continue to collect the $ 500- $ 600 monthly in addition to any amount she could retrieve from my checking account. I was led to believe that I could make payments at {$5.00} monthly based on my income after making 6 unaffordable payments. I am single mother taking care of XXXX children. 

I was instructed to write an email to a supervisor ( I think the email address was bogus because I never received an response ) and requested an appeal for lower payments to happen after I made the 6 payments ( through a garnishment I had no control over ). That email was sent in XX/XX/XXXX the same day I spoke to the XXXX representative. Prior to that call I had already made 4 payments. 

I was working through a XXXX agency and on XX/XX/XXXX my assignment ended. The next week I received a letter stating that my taxes would be garnished if I did not reply to their request to began making payments I could not afford nor had the money to make. I immediately wrote a letter explaining that I could not afford to make the payments and that my assignment ended. 

I have made numerous calls and written emails and letters requesting ( this was according to their letter with instructions on how to request an appeal and assistance regarding being entered into an income driven repayment system ) assistance with being entered into an income driven repayment plan, which was to no avail and only to be told my request was denied because my loan was in default. Previously I was told that my loan would be remove from default while making my previous payments and making at least 6 payments which were garnished from my payroll. 

Navient is manipulating this system and taking advantage of lower income families who work hard to provide a future for their families.

Or is it because we are a low-income family. How are XXXX practices allowed to continue? In Corporate America profit and greed are important factors.

9/15/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Hello, I consolidated my Federal Stafford loans ( roughly $ 50k ) received from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) in late XX/XX/XXXX after graduating from XXXX XXXX at XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX. I have managed to pay down my student loan balance since XX/XX/XXXX on time each month and was also able to pay additional amounts to help reduce the outstanding balance subject to interest charges. Based on a recent financial event that has allowed me to completely pay off my remaining balance, I paid {$10000.00} to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX is the servicer of my consolidated loans ). I did this by using the pay online function that displayed the 'payoff amount ' and simply entered that amount to pay off. 

After I did this, I remembered that XXXX offered 2 benefits when we were told about using the consolidation option for our subsidized and un-subsidized Stafford loans. One benefit was a 0.25 % interest rate reduction after a certain period of on time payments and I was given this benefit several years ago ( my interest rate went from 3.5 % to 3.25 % ). The other benefit was that the final {$590.00} of our loan balance would be forgiven if we continued to make our payments on time. It does not appear the XXXX website gave me the benefit of the {$590.00} forgiveness so I emailed XXXX about my questions regarding this forgiveness benefit. I was told ( emails back and forth with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX ) that since I paid my entire loan balance off, that I am not eligible to receive this forgiveness option. 

I have a hard time understanding this since I 've been a good payer on my loans owned by XXXX and serviced by XXXX for over 10 years. I have also paid thousands of dollars in interest charges since XX/XX/XXXX on my amount borrowed, so I do n't believe that being able to receive the benefit of the {$590.00} forgiveness benefit is something that is such a terrible request even if I am able to pay off my loan early. If I had realized this, I would have simply paid the full amount due minus the {$590.00} so it would have been forgiven through whatever process they have set up. But because I did pay off my entire balance, XXXX is telling me that I 'm not eligible to receive the forgiveness benefit. 

I find this very unfair since I have been a faithful payer on my loans and am being penalized for paying off my entire balance. Also, why does n't the XXXX website allow for consumers to understand this forgiveness? {$590.00} is a lot of money and I do n't believe it 's asking too much to receive the benefit that XXXX has given others that qualify for it like I do.

9/11/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"On Friday XX/XX/XXXX ( the due date for my student loan ) I noticed that my student loan bill from Nelnet was still showing as due. In fact it showed that the payment was overdue and my new amount due by XX/XX/XXXX was {$1100.00}. Thinking I had somehow missed my payment I scheduled a payment to be made on XX/XX/XXXX. I thought I had made the payment previously, but I checked my account and could not see any pending payments or anywhere where I had scheduled the payment already. 

Then on XX/XX/XXXX I saw that two payments were being processed from my checking account. Apparently I had scheduled a payment for XX/XX/XXXX at the end of XX/XX/XXXX. Since the website did not show this payment I was induced to pay the student loan twice, wrongfully. 

I called Nelnet and asked them to reverse the second payment on my account. They refused. I asked them why they do not show scheduled payments. She had no answer and said I could file a complaint. I told her their website should clearly show to the consumer when they have already scheduled a payment. She said she would note that on my complaint form. 

It appears that Nelnet has purposefully set up their website to cause confusion. In fact one could argue their website is misleading. I truly thought I had missed my XX/XX/XXXX payment when I did not. They said they will apply the double payment to my XX/XX/XXXX statement. But that does not solve the problem. Their website should clearly show when payments have been previously scheduled. I do not get any benefit for paying my XX/XX/XXXX payment early. They seem only concerned about collecting the money. Nelnet does not seem concerned that their website is misleading.
This issue should be addressed since it is very simple fix. Nearly every company I do business with online shows your scheduled payments. There is no reason Nelnet does not do it. One can only assume that they are purposefully leaving this option off their website to mislead consumers into paying their accounts early through erroneous double payments. Luckily I had funds in my account to cover this double payment. But someone else who makes this mistake may not. 

I have contacted my bank and been told that the only thing I can do is dispute the ACH. By the time that dispute is done I will have to make the XX/XX/XXXX payment so I should just let the payment stay. 

Nevertheless, Nelnet should be made to address this complaint. Their website is misleading. They need to change their website so that consumers can easily tell when they have already made their payments.",,"NELNET, INC.",VA,236XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/11/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2667654

6/14/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"In XXXX XXXX 2017, I was notified via my employer of a wage garnishment I was not aware of. I did research in an effort to find out exactly what had occurred. I went to the payroll department to find a letter, not a court order for garnishment of wages. In the letter, the following Federal law was quoted : 102-164. Upon further inquiry, it is a company called National Enterprise Systems. They were garnishing me without notification or any means of making arrangements to settle the debt. I have never heard of this company. Do I have students loans? Absolutely. I am currently in contact with those debtors. The amount of money they are taking out has caused grave consequences to my family. I am currently not able to provide for my children, I have XXXX and I also help my elderly parents which I have been providing assistance to. They are garnishing close to {$500.00} per month. I am not able to pay my rent in XXXX. I received a copy of the letter today from my employer thinking it was a court order which gives consumers the right to respond and settle the debt. It is not a court order, but a letter which I have attached. I am unable to survive with this kind of money being deducted from my account without sufficient notification to settle this dispute.
<P/>
The letter is attached which was obtained today. I contacted them with the number retrieved from the letter trying to find validity.

Based on the law they quoted, the following did not occur. : ( 2 ) the individual shall be provided written notice, sent by mail to the individuals last known address, a minimum of 30 days prior to the initiation of proceedings, from the guaranty agency or the Secretary, as appropriate, informing such individual of the nature and amount of the loan obligation to be collected, the intention of the guaranty agency or the Secretary, as appropriate, to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the rights of the individual under this section ; ( 3 ) the individual shall be provided an opportunity to inspect and copy records relating to the debt ; ( 4 ) the individual shall be provided an opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the guaranty agency or the Secretary, under terms agreeable to the Secretary, or the head of the guaranty agency or his designee, as appropriate, to establish a schedule for the repayment of the debt ; ( 5 ) the individual shall be provided an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with subsection ( b ) on the determination of the Secretary or the guaranty agency, as appropriate, concerning the existence or the amount of the debt, and, in the case of an individual whose repayment schedule is established other than by a written agreement pursuant to paragraph ( 4 ), concerning the terms of the repayment schedule ; ( 6 ) the employer shall pay to the Secretary or the guaranty agency as directed in the withholding order issued in this action, and shall be liable for, and the Secretary or the guaranty agency, as appropriate, may sue the employer in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction to recover, any amount that such employer fails to withhold from wages due an employee following receipt of such employer of notice of the withholding order, plus attorneys fees, costs, and, in the courts discretion, punitive damages, but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph ; ( 7 ) if an individual has been reemployed within 12 months after having been involuntarily separated from employment, no amount may be deducted from the disposable pay of such individual until such individual has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months ; and ( 8 ) an employer may not discharge from employment, refuse to employ, or take disciplinary action against an individual subject to wage withholding in accordance with this section by reason of the fact that the individuals wages have been subject to garnishment under this section, and such individual may sue in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction any employer who takes such action. The court shall award attorneys fees to a prevailing employee and, in its discretion, may order reinstatement of the individual, award punitive damages and back pay to the employee, or order such other remedy as may be reasonably necessary. Based on the law provided in their letter, not court order the following information is stated : I was never contacted via phone, mail, email or any other entity. If they were able to acquire my employment information, surely they could have contacted me if they had no way of contacting me. None of this occurred. I am not able to pay basic bills with this wage garnishment. I 'm am behind on basic needs after 3 garnishment deductions. Help is desperately needed in this matter.
<P/><P/>
( b ) Hearing requirements A hearing described in subsection ( a ) ( 5 ) shall be provided prior to issuance of a garnishment order if the individual, on or before the 15th day following the mailing of the notice described in subsection ( a ) ( 2 ), and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary or the head of the guaranty agency, as appropriate, may prescribe, files a petition requesting such a hearing. If the individual does not file a petition requesting a hearing prior to such date, the Secretary or the guaranty agency, as appropriate, shall provide the individual a hearing under subsection ( a ) ( 5 ) upon request, but such hearing need not be provided prior to issuance of a garnishment order. A hearing under subsection ( a ) ( 5 ) may not be conducted by an individual under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency, except that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to prohibit the appointment of an administrative law judge. The hearing official shall issue a final decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing.",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,"National Enterprise Systems, Inc.",FL,330XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,6/14/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2542777

10/20/16,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I graduated in XXXX with a XXXX XXXX degree and went to work for XXXX in Ohio. My family has a long history of XXXX. I was told in XXXX that XXXX Loans enrolled me in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. They did n't and they went out of business. They sold my loan to XXXX. I contacted them to make sure that it got transferred properly and that 's when I found out they never put my loan into that program. They assured me that they would fix it and that my loan would be in that program. They did n't and they went out of business. They sold my loan to Mohela. I just found out today that I have never been put on the right kind of repayment plan. 

I have made 7 years of payments, always on time, and none of them count. I was supposed to have loan forgiveness after 10 years of on time payments. I just want credit for my 7 years, because I had no way to know or even no way to check if what I was told actually happened. Even if the total of my payments would have been more than what I did pay, I am willing to pay any additional funds that I would have paid, had they done what they said they were doing. 

I am XXXX years old, and I want to retire someday, sooner rather than later. I have very little to retire on because I was a military spouse for 20 years and had a sporadic work history, and now I work in XXXX, so the social security administration is going to cheat me out of a lot of my retirement because I get XXXX retirement for part of my work history. ( That 's another messed up financial situation that your agency should look at. ) I will probably have to buy a mobile home with money I get from my parent 's house when they pass away, just to be able to afford to live in retirement. I ca n't pay student loans in retirement. If I could discharge them in bankruptcy, I would since I feel like I have been cheated. I have always paid all of my debts. I even almost lost a house in the recession but worked really hard to sell it at a loss rather than default. I lost XXXX dollars in home-ownership in the recession, because when I sold house number XXXX, it was XXXX and I had no idea that the whole economy would tank in XXXX. I purchased a condo in XXXX and it is currently worth XXXX less that I originally paid for it. 

When I first discovered the problem with XXXX, I found evidence of XXXX Loans doing this with a lot of people, but I no longer have the information. I know it 's there and could be found with some intensive XXXX or other searching. Please help me. I have always tried to do the right thing in life, and have gotten XXXX by circumstances, but this is just wrong and seems like it should be able to be fixed, since it was a couple of people who either lied or were just too incompetent to do the job right. No one wants to take any responsibility, and I just want this corrected since I did what I was supposed to do, and have dedicated my life to XXXX. I realize that the people who messed up my loan not once, but twice, are not able to be found. But I want someone now to step up and do the right thing, and fix this error.

1/21/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I am currently a borrower with Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, or XXXX XXXX. I am a borrower hoping to utilize the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. 

My issue with XXXX XXXX is their repeated miscalculations regarding my payments toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. Nearly everytime I submit an employment certification letter, my loan calculations are incorrect, or have changed significantly. I have three examples, with documentation to show a pattern of miscalculation. 

OnXX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from XXXX showing the number of payments made toward the PSLF program. One of my loans ( loan sequence 006 of 5 loans ) had 22 payments as of the date of that letter. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a similar letter after submitting another employment certification form, for which I earned 4 more payments toward PSLF. Yet, my loan ( sequence 006 ) now showed only 15 total payments toward the PSLF program. 11 payments, which were previously counted on the XX/XX/XXXXletter were missing. I have contacted XXXX twice about these missing payments and have yet to receive an updated calculation. 

Additionally, afterXX/XX/XXXX letter the rest of my loans ( sequence XXXX ) were each missing 1 payment. According to the XX/XX/XXXX letter, three of my loans ( XXXX ) had 23 payments counted toward the PSLF program. However, as of XX/XX/XXXX each of the loans now had 26 payments counted toward the PSLF program, even though the letter was to certify 4 more payments toward the program. Loans XXXX should be at 27 payments as of XX/XX/XXXX, not 26. 

Finally, According to the letter on XX/XX/XXXX, I had an employment certification from an organization from the dates of XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. This should count as 9 payments from that organization because I make payments on the XXXX of each month. Yet, the letter only counts 8 payments made toward the PSLF program. 

These three examples demonstrate a pattern of miscalculations from XXXX, all of which have served against me, and my progress toward the Public Service Loan Forgiveness. I have made repeated attempts to have these loan payments calculated correctly. At this point, there are so many issues that I think it has become difficult for the staff to remedy the situation. 

In addition to these three miscalculation examples, I still have not received payments made in XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX counted toward the PSLF program due to a retroactive in-school deferment placed on my account by XXXX XXXX. I have been waiting to have those payments counted.",,AES/PHEAA,CA,911XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,1/21/18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2788737
6/27/16,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"XXXX credit reporting service reduced my credit score by more than XXXX points in XXXX of 2015, dropping it from the high XXXX to the XXXX. My credit report states that I was 90 days late paying a student loan from XXXX University from University Accounting Services LLC ( henceforth "" UAS '' ). The monthly payment was XXXX. I used my XXXX XXXX XXXX autopay feature to debit my account to make the payments. I have done so since XXXX without missing a payment. 

For some unknown reason the payments for four month in late 2015 months were either not sent or received. The automatic payments resumed again in XXXX without my having done anything to change their settings. Stranger still, I had a smaller loan from UAS during the same period that was paid the on the exact same day as the larger lone and we never marked delinquent. 

I believe there was a either a systemic IT failure in XXXX XXXX XXXX 's automatic payment system or a similar failure in XXXX 's receipt system. My checking account balance was more than enough to make these payments. 

I was not contacted by XXXX University, XXXX XXXX XXXX, UAS, or XXXX about the delinquent account and had no reason to believe that this account was behind. Indeed, I have not missed a payment on any credit line in the past 16 years. These missing payments from XXXX are a clear deviation from this trend. 

Moreover, as attached, my bank statements for the months in question show clearly that the payments were debited from my account on time and sent to UAS during the months in question. I have attached a screenshot of my credit report as well as bank statements that provide evidence that my account was debited for XXXX each month. 

Neither of the XXXX other major credit reporting agencies noted the account as delinquent. 

The drop in my credit score will significantly reduce my ability to take out a mortgage or loan in the future or rent an apartment. If XXXX is unwilling to make such a change, then I would like to request a refund of all debits from the allegedly defaulted account, which total to several hundred dollars.",,TRANSWORLD SYSTEMS INC,CA,956XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/2/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1986458

I have qualified and been making payments on a Rate Reduction Plan, as I, nor my cosigner, can afford to make the previously quotes full payment of over {$800.00} per month. 

After several conversations with customer service members, I was offered a Rate Reduction Plan of {$280.00} per month, and that amount has been automatically deducted from my checking account on the XXXX of the every month for the past year. However, last month, on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX separate charges of {$53.00}, {$50.00}, {$49.00}, and {$47.00} were made to my checking account without warning or my consent. On XXXX, following these charges, my monthly payment of {$280.00} was automatically deducted as usual. As a result of these four unauthorized charges, my checking account was overdrawn and I had to reschedule payment on other bills. 

On Friday, XX/XX/XXXX upon discovering these extra charges to my account, I called Navient and spoke with a customer service representative. She informed me that the reason I was charged these extra fees was, "" another team member processed the payment without realizing payments had been automatically scheduled. '' When I asked the representative how quickly the charges could be reversed, she informed me that my case would not be reviewed until XX/XX/XXXX and charges would not be reimbursed for at least 5-7 business days after that. 

As a result of these charges, the rate reduction plan was cancelled and I was told to call back to make my XX/XX/XXXX payment and re-apply for the program. On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Navient in order to re-apply for the Rate Reduction Program I have been enrolled in for a year, and was told by the customer service representative that they, "" do not offer any sort of Income Based Reimbursement Program for private loans ; it is only offered for federal loans. '' When I disagreed and explained that I had been enrolled in this program for the last year, I was asked to hold and nobody returned to my phone call. 

I have submitted a previous complaint to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau regarding the initial monthly payment of over {$800.00} quoted in XX/XX/XXXX, and I am prepared to submit as many complaints that are required in order to resolve this matter.

I borrowed $ XXXX in Federal student loans. I have worked for non-profit safety-net health facilities and medical schools since XX/XX/XXXX. I transferred and consolidated my loans in the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as soon as I found out about the program, approx XX/XX/XXXX. My lender was AES in PA. In XX/XX/XXXX my debt transferred to XXXX. My payments were often beyond what I could afford, I asked for forbearance or deferment several times over the years. I have been paying between {$170.00} and currently {$650.00} a month for my student loans since XX/XX/XXXX. I now discover that I HAVE ONLY MADE 3 QUALIFYING PAYMENTS toward the 120 payments required for loan forgiveness. This is a bait and switch and a slap in the face. If this program is intended to reward public service, it is a failure. If this is intended to assist those who choose public service, it is a failure. Someone, I don't know who is profiting GREATLY from my payments and in exchange, I am receiving nothing. There is no appeals process and no room for renegotiation. It would be reasonable to examine how much I would have paid under the "" correct '' type of consolidation compared to how much I have paid and tell me the difference, if any, in order to pay the required amount to qualify for forgiveness. The Employment certification form OMB no. XXXX exp Date XX/XX/XXXX states that 4 different repayment plans [ REPAYE ; PAYE ; IBR or ICR ] qualify for this program which is also confusing.Becuase I am being told that only IBR qualifies?! As it stands I have probably paid back $ XXXX of the original $ XXXX but I am being given credit for less than $ XXXX in qualifying payments! My balance owed on these loans is about $ XXXX. Their horrendous customer service is motivating me to see how I can pay this off and prevent them from making any more money off of me. This is my second largest bill every month and I am treated like a thief when I call them. I don't know if it makes sense for me to stay with this program or perhaps I should just try to get a lower monthly payment with one of their other payment plans and forget forgiveness, although it appears the others DO qualify, despite what I am being told?

The other suggested auto-fill entry had an entire sentence from a personal letter, saved in a file folder about 7 layers deep within MyDocuments. That specific sentence is unique, and entered only one time, in one letter, saved in a separate file folder, even deeper within MyDocuments. It was never transmitted by email.

Wells Fargo finally charged off the account, offering settlements.

They demanded payment in full, around $ XXXX. 

Before I XXXX in XXXX and knowing I would have my security clearance renewal, which this would jam me up for, I contacted Wells Fargo and offered again to set up payments and told them I will seek tort relief if I lose my reserves job because they refused to set up a payment plan. They again refused. 

When I returned from XXXX I was one more tax return away from paying the IRS in full. Before I could call them they called me back and offered settlement.

They accepted and I've been making those payments monthly ever since.However, my credit report doesn't show I'm making payments and merely continues to show charge off each month.

8/1/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"When my student loan was sold to Nelnet for servicing I was offered a lower incentive interest rate ( 4.125 % rather than 5.625 % ) for making the first 36 payments on time. I did and my interest rate was lowered in XXXX. In XXXX I began making large payments on my loan, roughly {$1000.00} per month. I was trying to pay down the principal and when I inquired to Nelnet as to the best way to do so, I was told to simply make the large payments. Because I was making large payments I would receive monthly statements from Nelnet indicating that I did not owe a monthly payment and that I was current through XX/XX/XXXX. I switched to a lower paying job in XXXX and did not make any payments. I continued to receive monthly statements until XX/XX/XXXX reflecting that I did not owe anything. I picked back up with payments in XX/XX/XXXX and received a letter that I had lost the incentive interest rate earned in XXXX and that my interest rate was being raised to 5.625 %. When I called XXXX to inquire as to why, I was told that my loan had been transferred, that XXXX had missed a payment and that it was an error. My interest rate was adjusted back down to 4.125 % for one month. In XX/XX/XXXX I received another letter stating that my interest rate was again raised. When I called Nelnet to again inquire as to why and was told that my payments were not on time. The first individual with whom I spoke stated that, although I did not owe Nelnet any money in XXXX and was sent statements reflecting as such, my interest rate was being raised because my payments were not on time in XXXX. When I asked to speak to that person 's supervisor I was told that I lost the incentive interest rate because I did not make payments in XXXX, even though Nelnet continually sent me statements that said I did not owe any money and that I did not owe a payment until XX/XX/XXXX. I asked to speak to that person 's supervisor, who then told me that I lost the incentive interest rate because my XX/XX/XXXX payment was due on XX/XX/XXXX and I'd made it on XX/XX/XXXX. I pulled up my online statement, which shows my XXXX payment on XX/XX/XXXX. I was then told that my payment was not 'on time ' because it was too early. It was explained that this was the case even though when the money was due ( XX/XX/XXXX ) it had already been paid on XX/XX/XXXX and I did not owe anything on the "" due '' date. The Nelnet supervisor agreed that I was not ( and still am not ) delinquent on my payment and that I had never made a late payment. I asked where in writing I was notified that by making a payment too early, or making large payments throughout XXXX ( as Nelnet instructed me to do ) I would lose the lower interest rate. I was told that this is not in writing, but because it is an incentive Nelnet could simply raise my rate. The supervisor was looking further into the matter. Today I received another call from Nelnet and the individual with whom I spoke told me that I lost the incentive because my payment due XX/XX/XXXX was not paid until XX/XX/XXXX. This is now the third reason I have been given for losing my lower interest rate. Nonetheless, the individual with whom I spoke also agreed that my account is current and that my payments have not been late or too early. Regardless, I made a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and my XX/XX/XXXX payment was not late. Nelnet could not explain why it has taken almost 2 years for it to notice this alleged late payment, but their own records show my XX/XX/XXXX payment. To summarize, Nelnet acknowledges that my account is current, I have never made a late payment and it sent me statements for over a year that reflect that I do not owe it any money. It has now given me three different reasons why my interest rate was raised, but admits that none of the justifications it has given are actually in writing anywhere. Nelnet can not give me a legal/contractual reason for raising my rate, or any factual support for doing so.",,"NELNET, INC.",OH,430XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/1/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2977839

7/20/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"XXXX XXXX manages my loans but is incorrectly recording the number of qualifying payments I have made toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). I had multiple email exchanges with their department of Consumer Advocacy last year to try to straighten it out. Below is the text of a letter I sent to XXXX in XXXX, I have received no response. 
"" XXXX Dear XXXX XXXX I am writing in regard to my Public Service Loan Forgiveness tracking. I believe your records are  incorrect as to the number of qualifying payments I have made on my loans. I checked with XXXX, who held my loans before they were transferred to XXXX ( I also attempted to check with XXXX, who held my loans before XXXX, but they no longer have records on file ). XXXX  records indicate that I was on an Income Based Repayment plan from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX for one of my loans, and XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX for the other. ( Obviously, the latter time period includes payments that are ineligible because they were before XX/XX/XXXX and there was a gap from XXXX when I returned to school so my loans were deferred. ) The paperwork I received from XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX lists these payment periods as being on an ineligible repayment plan but does not list which plan. IBR is eligible, so I wonder if there was not a mistake made when my loans were transferred from XXXX to XXXX. I received another message from XXXX recently adjusting the number of remaining payments, but this is still not correct. If XXXX asserts that I was on an ineligible plan, I would like to see the documentation indicating exactly which plan I was on for each payment I have made ( to XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX ) over the course of the life of these loans, beginning in XXXX. Documentation from XXXX is attached. I have been very disappointed in the way my account has been handled, months go by before I get a response to messages, and out of the blue I get notification that youve removed more of my qualifying payments without providing justification. '' Here is text of one of the last emails I sent to their office of Consumer Advocacy last summer, the issue  has not been resolved. 
"" XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX  to Office Hi XXXX I am following up on your phone call from XX/XX/XXXX regarding the status of my PSLF application. I have reviewed all of the documents available to me on XXXX. The number of qualifying payments has been updated ( as of XX/XX/XXXX ) but are still not correct. I am pasting below summary information about my payment history based on my employment dates. ( I don't have actual school separation dates and grace period/deferment dates, so I have tried to make conservative estimates ). The paperwork I have received from XXXX does not match up with my calculations. I would like to see information about why certain payments did not qualify. All of my employers have been qualifying entities ( education/non-profit ) and I believe that I have been on some sort of income-based plan since the start of my repayments in XXXX. I know that I had changed which type of plan and had direct debits put on hold during plan changes or annual re-certification, but each time I asked customer service representatives if that would affect my PSLF plan and was told not to worry, it would not. I also know that my loans have changed hands ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX, and now XXXX ) so I am hoping that is not the problem. 

So, the first question is which payments did XXXX consider to be qualifying and which did not? I would like documentation of this for my records. The second question is why both of my loan accounts have not had an equal number of qualifying payments since XXXX? Note that during my time at XXXX, only 2 payments counted toward one loan and 4 toward the other loan. Is there some sort of issue where my monthly direct debits are not paying on both accounts?

2/4/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My current loan balance has ballooned over the years. It has ballooned to an estimate 200 % since its early balance. I believe the balance has been illegally reconstructed each time it has been transferred to a new loan servicer. I also believe the balance has been fraudulently consumed with unethical interest rates used by all loan servicers over the life of my school loans. My loan has been owned by a total of 4 loan servicing companies with 3 being mandated by the US Dept of Education. 

My current loan servicer is XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) : account # XXXX. This loan was transferred and acquired on XX/XX/XXXX. This particular loan servicing organization did not transfer the history of payments from Navient ( account # XXXX ). I was making satisfactory Income Based payments with XXXX when the transfer took place therefore increasing the monthly income based payment amounts dramatically to an entirely different amount, which was larger. The new introduced amount lets me know the interest rate was changed and the recent payments were not applied from XXXX history. 

The same situation involving my XXXX also occurred during the transfer of my XXXX account from XXXX XXXX. This transfer took place on XX/XX/XXXX. 

Also, when applying for any income based school loan I have found that the Loan Servicer does not apply all evidence on the tax forms that adjust the AGI nor do they take into account ( or inquire ) the cost of living and daily life events ie medical bills, medical premiums, rent, electrical bills, water bills, number of family members, constant increase in rent every 18 months, inflation changes based on the state of resident, etc.",,AES/PHEAA,CA,945XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2/4/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2803283

They claimed that they were acting as an agent for XXXX XXXX. It took several months to receive this information. At first, they would n't state who they were collecting on behalf of, and both XXXX XXXX XXXX and my workplace did not provide me with any documentation. Upon being told of XXXX XXXX, I contacted the number. The number was actually for Navient. I then filed a complaint against Navient ( number referenced above ), and via the CFPB portal, Navient had the audacity to provide me with a fillable PDF as my supposed Master Promissory Note. The information is so fake that it does n't even have my actual, legal name. Every single line on the form has inaccurate information. In the CFPB response, Navient claimed that they were acting on behalf of XXXX XXXX, and that I needed to contact XXXX XXXX. The number provided was again for Navient. I have had multiple recorded telephone conversations with Navient, and they continue to claim that they are speaking directly with XXXX XXXX and operating on their behalf. As you are aware, XXXX XXXX is actually XXXX XXXX and has undergone a name change. They clearly list on their website that any student loans are being serviced by XXXX XXXX. I never had any loans with XXXX XXXX, Navient, XXXX, or any other entity. I do not owe any monies to XXXX XXXX, Navient, XXXX, or XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I contacted my college about this, and they referred me to two government sites myeddebt.ed.gov and studentloans.gov. Both sites verify that I did not obtain student loans to attend the XXXX XXXX XXXX. In addition, they reveal that I did not have any form of student loan documentation at all, including loan counseling, which would have needed to occur. Navient then mailed me a fake loan exit counseling form. It has all initials for the first names, and these are made up names. My name is not shared by any other family members ( parents and in-laws ), so the lies are extremely blatant. It also lists workplaces, such as XXXX 'XXXX and XXXX XXXX, which did n't exist during the time I went to school, and I have never known anyone who works at such places. Further, it lists the wrong residence for me, in addition to not listing my actual legal name. To me, the most egregious error is providing a fillable Master Promissory Note PDF. During the time I attended college ( XXXX ), there was n't the ability to email fillable PDF forms. I am entitled to the original document and there should at least be a "" true and correct copy '' ; the fact that Navient thinks it can just fill in the information and send it as a changeable file is appalling. After complaining about this, Navient then sent me a second MPN in the mail via USPS. This MPN is different than the one provided online via the CFPB portal. It is also fake, and the fact that there are now two reveals that Navient is literally creating these documents in the modern era. In the case of the mailed document, Navient has placed an "" 8 '' symbol where a checkmark should be ; that would n't have been possible in XXXX. In a recorded conversation with XXXX XXXX, the Customer Advocate for Navient, I repeatedly requested the number for XXXX XXXX. At the end of the conversation, she admitted that she had been the individual to respond to the XX/XX/XXXX CFPB complaint and that she had provided me with the XXXX number, claiming it was XXXX XXXX, when, in fact, it was Navient. I requested the number again ; she claimed there was no XXXX number and gave me : XXXX. That number is also Navient. After providing proof of such, I was then referred to a new Customer Advocate, XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX similarly continues to claim that XXXX XXXX  exists, but similarly provides contact information for Navient. Navient is clearly fraudulently representing itself as XXXX XXXX. It is claiming guarantor status, when it does not have that status, and it is actively fabricating fake Master Promissory Notes and other loan documents, such as exit counseling documents. In the recorded conversation, XXXX XXXX claimed that it had to be the XXXX XXXX XXXX who did this. So, Navient is also openly and actively defaming colleges and then attempting to collect money not owed to Navient. In addition to these problems, Navient has tried to claim that they can collect on loans that the Federal Government has already said they can not collect on. In the CFPB complaint response, Navient states that three loans are uninsured and not able to be defaulted. That is because these loans from before XX/XX/XXXX were PAID.  Navient has been told this repeatedly, and yet, they are still contacting me about something they have been expressly forbidden from harassing me about. I want to be part of the class action against Navient. They have wasted seven months of my life. I have had communication from them at least every two days for the last seven months, and they will not cease and desist, even though they have been sent a Notice of Intent to Sue.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",CA,954XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,7/6/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2567033
3/30/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Keep getting calls about my loan,"Iowa Student Loans, now Aspire, has consistently called us and our daughter regarding her outstanding loan from XXXX College. As was necessary, she obtained several loans over the period of four years. As her parents, we co-signed her loans. After college we made repeated attempts to consolidate her loans. The response was "" not possible ''. The result was XXXX loans, each due on different time of the month, all accruing interest. We attempted to set up a regular schedule, and, new to the workforce, she did her best to meet the loan payments. We helped as we could to offset the payments. Since 2004, we have consistently received letters and harsh, demanding phonecalls, sometimes threatening, even though we know the amount was regularly late, but paid in accordance with her and our pay checks. Had we known a student loan from Iowa Student Loans, now Aspire would be so physiologically demanding, we would never have used them. Even the credit card companies have been willing to work with us on consolidating and paying off a card. We have attempted numerous times to talk with the Iowa Student Loans, now Aspire to consolidate and make it easier for our daughter, and now us, to repay the loans. They are unrelenting, offering no options and constantly sending letters and telephone calls. We know the loans are being paid, however, if they are off by only a few days, even due to holidays, the phone calls and cautionary letters arrive.

1/28/16,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Can't repay my loan,Can't decrease my monthly payments,"Perhaps this is a common problem. I have had private law school loans since 1998. These loans are currently split between XXXX service providers - XXXX ( formerly XXXX XXXX ) and Access Group ( ACS ). Since my loans went into repayment, I never missed a payment, and paid my full amount owed every month. However, in the last couple of years, I 've had some challenges. I had to take time off from full-time employment due to some health issues, and we needed to relocate for my husband 's job across the country. I had a baby. I needed to stay home for a while. With both loan providers, I was able to suspend the federal loans, but the private ones have been more problematic. I am told I have no other options with those at this point. The monthly for ACS is {$270.00} and the monthly for XXXX is {$230.00}. The financial stress on our family is significant because of this, as I am not bringing in an income and not receiving any type of unemployment assistance. The lenders claim I have no options. I asked if it might be possible for me to pay a lower amount each month until I obtain employment. The answer was no, that this would still be considered default, even if I paid XXXX-XXXX percent of the amount owed each month. Essentially paying a substantial portion counts for nothing. I feel that this makes no sense and is borderline predatory. It seems as if trying to work out an arrangement with them is impossible. I understand why people give up and do n't pay at all. However, I have excellent credit and it 's important to me to retain this. It 's going to wipe out our savings over the next few months. I think the unwillingness to work with clients during financial difficulties is a real problem. This is not credit card debt. Most of us with these loans are responsible consumers. The failure to work with an individual who is willing to pay the maximum possible in his/her current financial situation, is something that I felt was worth documenting.

I have a couple of problems. 1. No one who assists you with the loan application when you are applying makes any statements about the ability of the loan to compound daily.

If I am not allowed to apply over payments towards principal, this would also be the only loan that I am aware of that you can not pay down the principal with extra payments.

( When I set up the auto-payment earlier this year, no-one mentioned that the interest accrues at {$130.00} a month. ) When I set up my auto pay, I wanted to start dropping the principal, so I elected to pay more, {$170.00} a month.

A late payment to my student loan account means that I have multiple late payments for the same loan. So I may have 13 late payments which harshly affects my credit.

The problems began when my balance was transferred from my original lender, XXXX, to XXXX : I was not provided notice of this transfer until after the fact, and two of my monthly payments went to the original lender, which was very difficult to get corrected. 

More importantly, once it came time to recertify for the IDR, which I was enrolled in through XXXX, I encountered one issue after another with XXXX. The deadline had passed due to issues on XXXX 's end, being unable to process requests due to high volume at that time. When the recertification request finally was processed, it was denied ; the reason stated on the website was that certain documentation was missing. I submitted the documentation and the request was denied again. 

In attempting to resolve these issues, I had multiple calls with XXXX reps, all of whom were unhelpful. My IDR request was finally "" approved, '' but with an increased monthly payment ( from {$86.00} to {$320.00} ), even though my total household income and dependent information hadn't changed between XXXX and XXXX. 

This issue necessitated additional calls to XXXX reps ; again, none of which were helpful, and ultimately I was told that XXXX had no way of determining why my payments had increased so drastically. According to XXXX, because the initial payment amount of {$86.00} was set up through XXXX, XXXX has no record of the original IDR calculation and no way of obtaining it.

3/24/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"At the beginning of XX/XX/2016, my income was incorrectly calculated by FedLoan. Because of their error in calculations, my income-based monthly payment was approximately 3x higher than it should have been, and it was impossible for me to pay. When I contacted FedLoan, they told me that the only solution to the problem would be for them to conduct a review of the situation and try to sort it out. When I asked how long this would take, they said it could take up to 3 months after receiving additional paperwork from me ( paperwork I had already previously completed and submitted months before ). They also said I would have to pay the incorrectly calculated monthly payment ( & gt ; 25 % of my take-home pay for the month ). They asked for me to resubmit my proof of income, and they also made me complete ( AGAIN ) another income-based repayment enrollment request and mail it to them. I did all of this. Over a month later, I called for an update and there had been no progress. One individual I spoke to said that the additional paperwork I sent had been received, but had been incorrectly filed. Therefore, they needed me to send it again. Because I could not pay the incorrectly calculated monthly payment amount, they said my only option was to put my account into forbearance. Keep in mind, I had been making monthly payments on my loan since I graduated from school - NEVER putting them in forbearance or deferral. I filled out their paperwork a third time and submitted it. Over the next 4 months, I called FedLoan monthly to check in with them, wasting hours of time waiting on the phone. Over these 5 months, I had to put my account in temporary, monthly FORBEARANCE FOUR TIMES since they could not get their act together. ( 1 ) During this time, my student loans accrued & gt ; {$5000.00} in interest, which was not being paid down since I could not make the payments THEY incorrectly calculated on my account! ( 2 ) Furthermore, I missed out on & gt ; 5 payments that would have counted towards the 120 payments required for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program. ( 3 ) Finally, as I was not able to make my normal payments on my account, I wound up paying 50 % less on my loan than I did last year, which negatively impacted my tax return. All of this ONLY because it took FedLoan & gt ; 6 months to resolve a simple issue which was their fault.

6/7/16,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"I completed the income-sensitive repayment plan application to reapply for a reduced payment plan. The form indicates to list the gross monthly income. It also requires that the XXXX most recent pay stubs are submitted. Since I am hourly, I do not work the same hours each week ; therefore, the amount that I list for my gross monthly income is an estimate. Since there are seasonal busy periods, the hours that I am working now are inflated compared to what I am actually scheduled to work. As a result, this makes it appear that I earn much more than what I do. Last year, I encountered the same issue and after numerous tear-filled phone calls, I was instructed to write a note that I was an hourly employee and include what my average scheduled hours were. This year, in an effort to avoid having my application rejected, I included the same explanation. Sure enough, a week later, my application was rejected. I called and spoke to a representative who accused me of understating my wages. I explained to her that I was hourly and did not have a set salary, and she instructed me that I would have to match my gross monthly income to the amount on the pay stubs regardless of the fact that the hours were not typical. I immediately requested a supervisor since I had encountered the same issue the previous year. I explained that I did not feel comfortable listing the inflated amount as my gross monthly wages since it overstated my actual earnings. The woman was very rude and condescending. She then began asking all these questions about my tax returns and other personal information as if she was attempting to refinance my loans. Not only was I unprepared for the questions, since I was commuting to work, but I could not understand her due to a very heavy accent. Since I work for a non-profit, refinancing a loan would be unwise because it would disqualify me from Public Service Federal Loan Forgiveness. When I asked why she needed the information she was requesting, she became agitated and told me she was attempting to qualify me for a different loan. I informed her that I was not comfortable or prepared for that and would call back. As she yelled something at me through the phone, I hung up. Because I feel like I have no other option, I am have submitted my forms with the inflated wages they demand. I find it absolutely insulting that I am trying to pay for my loans and I feel like they are attempting to rip me off by changing the terms.

6/16/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"AES has continuously evaded and denied my requests to provide factual evidence that supports their claim that I requeste d nine ( 9 )  deferments and forbearances on  nine ( 9 )  different occasions ; simply because they are lying and no such evidence exists. I never requested any such changes to this account and most definitely not on  nine ( 9 )  different occasions. They applied these changes for the purposes of extending the time it would take for these tradelines to fall off of my credit report, and possibly for financial advantages.   This is pure speculation until a real investigation is conducted, but I believe  AES  is somehow illegally profiting from ensuring this debt remains open. Consider this : I have never paid them and never will based on the circumstances outlined in my dispute letters i.e. I am a victim of the    XXXX    financial crisis. They also know that I will always dispute this debt and that the statute of limitations is expired-time barred debt.   So why would  AES  intentionally keep this account open knowing these facts instead of simply closing it out?   Why would AES willfully change the reported information from defaulted or delinquent to current or good standing when technically since I never made any payments the default status was accurate?   Of course, I made several formal complaints and told them to remove all negative information from my credit report. But why would  AES  agree to do that when they knew that I would never agree to pay any portion of this debt? I know the answer is certainly not because AES cares about the financial wellbeing of their borrowers.   It makes no sense for a business who is well aware of all of these facts to pursue this outrageous debt and alter and conceal delinquency/default dates right before it charges off. Unless of course there exists a financial benefit in doing so. It may be possible that by falsifying a forbearance, AES is reimbursed monthly in the amount equal to the insanely high monthly payments. In other words, its possible that AES is deliberately reporting disinformation that the account is in forbearance-which gives the false notion that I agree to pay once I can afford payments, in order to receive an IOU or tax break.   Its also possible that  AES  is receiving this financial incentive from the very state that clearly has a conflict of interest- Pennsylvania  .  The PA Attorney General refused to conduct a thorough investigation or even attempt to resolve the issue based on their relationship with  AES  and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agenc y ( PHEAA ) . Whatever the case  may be, AES  is clearly benefitting financially from engaging in their illicit activities and they are receiving protection from some other entity who is either wittingly conspiring and aiding in these fraudulent activities, or AES is defrauding their protector.   AES is a business, and the fundamental purpose of a business is to generate profit. It is illogical to think that a business would purposely do something  ( m ultiple times ) that would cause detriment to their profit i.e. wasting resources in pursuing a debt that will never be recovered.   In theory, a collection agency could attempt to get payment from you endlessly, but in practice, that doesnt happen. Eventually, the collection efforts will cost more than any payment they will receive, so it doesnt make business sense to continue to try to collect the debt.   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   In some states, if you pay any amount on a time-barred debt or even promise to pay, the debt is 'revived. ' This means the clock resets and a new statute of limitations period begins. It also often means the collector can sue you to collect the full amount of the debt, which  may  include additional interest and fees.     XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  So, what benefit would AES hav e in  pursuing this debt? Why would AES apply fictitious forbearances on the account? It is possible that falsifying a deferment or forbearance would imply that I promise to pay at a more suitable time. That implication could in theory reset the clock for the statute of limitations, thus allowing  AES  to file suit if I refuse to pay. Further, applying such changes to this debt would reflect on their accounting records as valid/in good standing/paid as agreed, thereby avoiding the negative impact a charge off or closed account would have on their business.   Its common for consumers to default or fall behind on their payments, and in those cases the creditor and collection agency do everything in their powers to inflict as much emotional and financial distress onto the consumer until they pay. Now, the tables have turned and rest assured I will see to it that AES is held responsible. It was the lender  (   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX   XXXX  ) who defaulted, failed to pay, neglected their financial obligation, and neglected their fiduciary duty. Should the consumer be held responsible for their wrong doings? Are there no laws that protect the consumer against financial giants who abuse the system like this? The cause and effect for this situation is no different than that of the mortgage crisis, the only difference is that were dealing with a private student loan.   AES needs to come to terms with the fact they made the mistake of servicing a predatory loan that was breached by the lender. They need to come to terms that this is their loss and are only making matters worse for themselves. I refuse to take responsibility for the lenders financial hardship and refuse to pay for something that I was cheated out of, something that I was promised and did not receive. It is the lenders own fault for their bankruptcy and for leaving hundreds of students feeling helpless and hopeless because they were denied what they were promised, the opportunity to succeed by way of financial support. It is unfair and illegal for  AES  to place this burden upon me or any other consumer and pursue a debt that they know full well they shouldnt.   Additionally, everyone seems to be missing  one  of the most important facts ;  XXXX  already deleted all  four ( 4 ) tr adelines from my credit report as a result of their investigation in  XX/XX/XXXX . Is this not relevant? How can  XXXX  conclude that these tradelines should be completely deleted and are invalid, but not  XXXX  or  XXXX  when this account was disputed in the same manner? Further,  XXXX  is reporting that  one ( 1 ) of the four ( 4 ) tr adelines is closed/paid. Credit information must be the same across all credit reporting agencies per FCRA. This should be sufficient evidence to investigate the validity of these tradelines and come to the same conclusion as  XXXX .   This issue calls upon experts in the fields of taxation, securities, bankruptcy, and consumer protection. It is obvious AES is involved in illegal activities i.e. violating consumer protection laws, falsifying documents, reporting disinformation, etc. and this fact must not be ignored. AES, PHEAA,  XXXX , and  XXXX  should all be scrutinized and investigated for potentially engaging in financial crimes that defraud consumers and the government. I will continue to place pressure on AES,  XXXX , and  XXXX  with the intention of forcing them to authorize the removal of all tradelines from my credit reports ; unless I am explicitly told by all investigating authorities and/or receive a judgement indicating that I am indeed responsible for this debt and obligated to pay.  <P/> DISCLAIMER : I WILL NEVER AGREE TO PAY ANY PORTION OF THE DEBT YOU CLAIM I OWE DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OUTLINED IN MY PREVIOUS DISPUTE LETTERS. ANY ATTMEPT TO COLLECT THIS DEBT WILL BE A DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE FCRA AND FDCPA.

Although I never agreed to this loan, I do not want to pursue criminal charges against my dad, BUT I do not agree with Wells ' Fargo business practices concerning my dispute about this loan. This loan has gone into default twice and has been reported as 30 days late to my credit bureau. I 've told my dad countless times that if he thinks he is not going to be able to make the payment to contact me before it becomes late so that I can try to cover the payment. However, that has not happened. My mom did let me know that due to my dad being out of work and without a car due to a car accident, that he will not be able to make a payment on time. 

I contacted Wells Fargo today, because I feel that I 'm left out of the loop in terms of when a payment is due, if it 's behind, etc. The only time I 'm made aware that a payment is due, is when it 's already BEHIND!!! How is that fair for a consumer who is only trying to do the right thing by repaying a loan that was never requested by her? Additionally, my request to Wells Fargo was to grant me access to view this account online, so that I do not find myself in the same predicament and wind up with another 30 day late reporting on my credit file. The representative, although pleasant, did not have any options to assist me. She advised me as a co-signer that I do not have access to view the loan online, only the borrower can, and also advised to get a monthly statement, I would have to call in and request it!!! Again how is this fair??? 

I 've come to terms that Wells Fargo is not going to do the right thing and remove my name from this loan, but to not give me all the tools to manage the loan, by granting me online access, which is how I maintain all my other bills, which are paid on time, might I add!!! Then to state I have to call in to request a statement each month is mind-boggling, BUT if a payment is behind, there is no hesitation in reporting this on MY credit file. I feel that this is not only unfair, by unlawful, and it feels they are putting me in a position where I always have to worry about whether this bill is going to be paid on time. It has caused me great stress, and has prevented me from being able to obtain a competitive home loan. With this recent 30 day late on my credit file, my score dropped XXXX pts.!!! 

My request from Wells Fargo at this time is to do the right thing, which would be to remove these 30 day lates from my credit file, since they do not give me the proper tools to manage this loan. I also request that if they are not going to remove my name from this loan that they also grant me access to view and make payments online, and mail monthly statements without me having to request them each month.

I began repayment in XXXX. I have had an ongoing problem with Navient constantly calling my phone at all times day and night up to XXXX XXXX. I have told them to stop and they do for a few weeks and continue. They also send me emails with reflecting the current payment. If its so much as 5 days late they send me emails showing the amount rising for the total of several payments progressively. 

My co-signer ( XXXX XXXX ) Contacted me in XX/XX/XXXX. He stated he saw I was making payments of {$80.00} towards the loan ( which is more than I was required to pay ) he co-signed for as well as the one I had on my own. Mr. XXXX called Navient and discovered they were placing the payments on solo my loan as it was the lower amount bringing up the interest and total balance of my co-signed loaned. What bothers me is that I sent checks via XXXX  XXXX XXXX to the two separate accounts. Navient took it upon themselves to place the money in toward the one account and raise the interest on the one co-signedhow is that fair anyway shape or form???. I called them and asked about this. The clerk I spoke to was evasive with answers. I told them I wanted a detailed breakdown of my Federal and Private loan accounts. I was told this was not a problem and they said they would mail it to me. I never received it. I suspect the same issue is going on with my Federal Loans as well. Navient is placing money and keeping interest by doing this making it an extreme hardship for borrowers. I would like this brought to your attention due to Navients recent criticism and allegations of illegal handling of student loans. I seek any and all relief due if available in the future. It is a sad state when corporations take advantage of people paying what they owe and trying to better themselves.

When I made a lump sum payment of {$58000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX, at the time I assumed my loan was paid in full because this was the total amount and even if it wan'ts in full, I would not assumed that Nelnet would automatically EXTEND my due date so that I can unknowingly continue to pay interest until XX/XX/XXXX. Customer service informed me that I paid off the principle balance but neglected the interest, if I would of known I would off paid it off the following month when my statement comes but since they automatically extended the due date, I wouldn't have known unless I received an email stating that my tax documents was ready- which I usually ignore since I know that I paid off the loan in XX/XX/XXXX thus nothing to report on. 

This automatic due date extension is extremely deceptive. You can pay off your total amount due ( or what you presume is due ) but since interest is compounded daily, you actually wouldn't of pay in full unless you call and get the actual total for that day.

2/20/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I was contacted by phone by a company called XXXX XXXX about student loan forgiveness. I spoke at length with Fed Loans on what the process would be. They excused the down payment for the service because of my financial situation and was given a monthly payment of XXXX. That sounded great to me. I had to submit my tax documents for the previous year and was approved because I work for a company that partners with many government agencies. I was now getting statements from XXXX  XXXX with XXXX payment due. I then went to register my account online and found it to be a different company than XXXX XXXX. I checked the email to make sure it was the same thing that I signed up for and the information matched. I then called the company ( Equitable Acceptance Corporation ( EAC ) ) and was told by EAC that if I pay that XXXX the balance of what was left on my loans would be forgiven. They represented themselves as XXXX XXXX but now they were EAC and  XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

18 months later, I received a bill from XXXX XXXX advising me to pay {$850.00} by XX/XX/XXXX. I then received a statement from XXXX  XXXX of back interest that was due plus payment. When I called XXXX XXXX they told me that I didn't have to continue to pay that they were scamming me. I just looked at my account with EAC and see that I've been paying XXXX a month for over a year and a half but that I've been charged interest that I was not made aware of. The interest is half of what i pay each month. I did not realize that this is really no more than a "" credit card '' that I did not approve. The fee was XXXX which of course I couldn't pay but with the information I gave about my financial situation they waived the down payment and said I could do monthly payments. I have been paying since XX/XX/XXXX and my balance is still XXXX. I have paid over {$300.00} in interest and about {$85.00} towards the principle. My XXXX, that's crazy! I now know this is a scam and this could reduce my credit rating tremendously. 

I called EAC for about a month from XX/XX/XXXX until today, every other day. EAC told me that XXXX XXXX went out of business, so that's why XXXX XXXX was reaching out to me. I was told my case was being resigned to another company for forgiveness. They told me my case was being reassigned about 12 times. I was told it would take 1 week, 2 weeks,  and then several months for my case to be reassigned. They also said that my contract is with them but the service was with XXXX XXXX to pay the balance of my student loans. I signed a legal agreement with them and must pay them. They have nothing to do with the service issues. I advised them that I was paying for a service and that I was also recording the conversations on my end as well. I have about 15 recorded calls of them telling me that it's not their fault and I must pay because of the legal contract I e-signed. 

I am now about to be on a payment plan with the XXXX XXXX and need to find out how to resolve this situation with EAC. I would like a full refund for everything I have paid for, I would like the contract ended, and I don't want it to affect my credit rating. They out right lied to me and did bad business on purpose.

4/10/16,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I moved to XXXX in XXXX XXXX after finishing XXXX school at XXXX, and I was working for a XXXX company for the first 9 months that I lived abroad, but I was not making enough money to be able to afford to make my monthly payments on my student loans. I called Navient ( my loan servicer ) and asked them what I should do, and they only offered that I could qualify for deferment/forbearance. They never offered that I could potentially qualify for IBR, which would potentially give me a minimum monthly payment of {$0.00} per month, and that way I could at least get credit towards the 25 year repayment term that I 'm required to fulfill, since at the time of graduation in XX/XX/XXXX my outstanding loan balance was at least $ XXXX. During the time of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX I was unemployed for a period of time while still living in XXXX and then later I started freelancing in XXXX which meant that I did n't have a regular salary, and could not afford to make my monthly payments. I always kept in touch with Navient and they never once mentioned the possibility that I could qualify for the {$0.00} per month IBR repayment plan. So the interest on my outstanding loan balance continued to accumulate and my loan balance ballooned because I was unable to pay. XX/XX/XXXX I moved back to the USA and took a job where I was earning a modest full time salary, but I still could not afford to make monthly payments because I was trying to help my brother financially ( he 's a XXXX who has been XXXX in the past and has been struggling for a long time ) and I was also trying to help my mom financially because she has been, and continues to be, at high risk of homelessness. When I got laid off from my job in XXXX XXXX I contacted Navient to explain that I had lost my main source of income and they said it would be no problem. Navient instructed me to send in the application for IBR and to put down on the application that I had no income, which I did. I was then immediately placed onto a {$0.00} per month IBR plan, and this was the first time I discovered that this option even existed. I am extremely frustrated and feel cheated because Navient never informed me back around XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX that I might be able to qualify for the {$0.00} per month plan, since I was not making enough money to be able to make monthly loan payments. I would like to have Navient and/or the Dept. of Education retroactively issue me credit for the several years my loans were classified as economic hardship deferment/forbearance, so at least the years from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX will be counted towards satisfying the 25 year max repayment term. I do n't think it should be legal for Navient to withhold information from borrowers, and if I would have know about the {$0.00} per month IBR plan sooner, then I absolutely would have applied for it. Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I would also like to have the Dept. of Education assess whether Navient incorrectly calculated the interest rate on my loan balance during the period of XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX because I believe I should have been eligible for some kind of interest rate benefit due to my financial hardship and my inability to make payments.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NY,112XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/10/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1872399

He has recently started a new job with XXXX and we are getting our finances back on track. However, by the end of XXXX, I struggled to keep up with the payments and my student loans became dangerously past due. On or around XX/XX/XXXX, I arranged a {$250.00} student loan payment on line. I did not realize until it was too late that I had forgotten to change my banking information and the payment was rejected by my bank. ( I have since cleared this up. ) I called AES to discuss further options. On XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by a representative that I qualified for XXXX-day forbearance. When we discussed the unfortunate payment error, she said, "" do n't worry about it ; the forbearance period would cover the non-payment. On XX/XX/XXXX, my credit bureau monitoring service notified me that my credit score had dropped by over XXXX points due to a XXXX-day late payment reported by AES. This was AFTER I was assured that I qualified for the forbearance. 

When I called AES to inquire about this, I was told that credit reporting operated on a separate system and that credit reporting was "" automatic, '' but that he would note the situation in my file. All of the representatives have been very pleasant and helpful. However, as I explained to XXXX of the representatives, I am a consumer. When a representative tells me "" not to worry about a payment issue, '' I listen. My husband and I are XXXX veterans and have to commute 2 hours to work every day. We are responsible and have not missed a student loan payment in several years. We need to buy a home closer to our work. 

The problem is this. The loans with AES are a consolidated debt of XXXX different loans. When the loans were reported to credit bureau as XXXX days late, my credit scores dropped almost XXXX points for EACH LOAN. That 's approximately XXXX points!!! This is neither fair nor accurate. When payments are made, amounts are applied to each individual loan. The way this is set up, even if XXXX of the XXXX loans is late, ALL XXXX report late. No credit report can sustain and instant XXXX point drop in credit score over something this confusing. 

Like I stated earlier, I am a veteran and a responsible citizen. I struggled to pay the loans on time for the entire XXXX months my husband was out of work. It is not fair that I should have to suffer the insult of a XXXX day late payment due to misinformation that I was given. If I am late making payments due to neglect, then I would feel like I have earned this discredit. However, I was acting on information supplied to me by a company representative.

The adviser came out and I told her that I was interested in becoming a XXXX XXXX. She then advised that the "" XXXX XXXX '' program is where I should pursue my degree.

During the process for applying for student loans. Whenever I asked questions I was given a vague response. Like why is there a fee for dorm rooms? That is for everyone and that is how the loan is processed. I did not know I should have challenged the charges I just wanted to get my education. 

After completing my XXXX Degree XX/XX/XXXX I was informed by an enrollment advisor that I would need to complete my XXXX Degree in order to obtain the employment I was interested in. Again I was pressured to enroll which I did. 

Upon completion of my XXXX Degree XX/XX/XXXX I was informed that repayment would be due 6 months after graduating. This is when I began to look at my paperwork thoroughly and talk with other students. 

I noticed charges for dorm rooms and called to ask for explanations as there are no dorm rooms available at the FL campus. After several phone calls I was informed that I signed the paperwork and now was responsible for repayment. 

XXXX XXXX sent me a bill and I was unable to pay the amount they were requesting. I worked with XXXX XXXX as much as I could and struggled to make payments. Even taking money from a retirement account. Several years later I received notification that my loan was sold to XXXX. By this time I was a single parent and continued to struggle making payments. 

After hearing that the XXXX authorized "" loan forgiveness '' I tried very hard to make my payments monthly. Often times falling behind in my other bills. On a phone call to Navient ( sometime in XXXX ) to try and get on a payment plan as I could not afford my payment I mentioned to the representative that I was looking forward to "" loan forgiveness.

I owed {$32000.00} for my XXXX & XXXX. and plus capitalization which resulted in another $ XXXX being added to the loan..

Here are my thoughts on how the bank committed fraud and broken the agreement with me the student.    Need to have the original, wet-ink note I signed for review because : The bank may have changed the note to make it marketable from a securitization standpoint, thereby raising the issue of whether such changes have made the note invalid and unenforceable The assignments of the note I signed may not have occurred, or may have occurred through an illegal, forged or fraudulent way ; Also to see if the loan agreement owe me the student the duty of negotiating a loan modification agreement in good faith. Failure to negotiate in good faith would be a defense, arguably, to the note ; Failure to negotiate in good faith would be an defence.    The ban k may b e charging illegal, usurious interest on the loans in spite of various rulings which permit banks to charge usury ; I have had made various payments to other banks that that have not been reflected.   The ban k may have written  off the loan with the IRS ( evidence by a form  XXXX  ; ) I need a lawyer ask for the required docs and get a case against my loan note holder.   A lawyer could spend a few hours looking into ( and perhaps resolving some  of ) the  various issues I have outline.     Need him/her prepare and file a complaint but at all times you must make sure that any lawsuit is meritorious ( meaning, that you have a basis, which means that I was defrauded into signing the student loans for a course of study which the school knew statistically would not result in sufficient income for you to be able to service the loan ).     Bottom line Took out  XXXX  of loans 20 years ago and now owe  XXXX . Now repayment {$890.00} a month for 40 years.  XXXX  totally to pay off a student loan. That should be an felony . Plus they wi ll doc my Social Security too. This has gone too far!   There is a reason why student loans is more than a  XXXX  dollars business outstanding student loans.   Was denied financial aid in  XXXX  from  XXXX   XXXX  College and was told to resubmit paper work and fill out that I lived on a house boat, open  a PO box , handed a r ental contract and how to fill out student loans to qualify. The college must be getting kickbacks from the lenders and government. This is 100 % fraud. All I need is just have to have a court order to find it!   If any of the above request can not be meet, it would be a breach of contract. Right?   Take a look at this graph and tell me why its a  XXXX  dollar business. Because our corrupt government made it impossible to get out of a student loans and wants a national full of debt slaves.   I thinks the loan holder and college will settle out of court instead of opening a can of worms and with a risk of being a found guilty of fraud. If being presented with these issues and I think they would settle out of court.   A lawsuit, based on fraud, could also be commenced at the same time against the college and guarantor institution, both of which must have known about the fraud based upon the statistics the college had to prepare to publish. Even though th ey may not now  own the notes, their presence in the law suit might be helpful to encourage overall settlement of the lawsuit and to help us establish though discovery that the present owner of the notes is not the holder in due course and is subject to our defense of fraud.   Student loans are very similar to home mortgages. Both involve a purchaser acquiring massive, life time debt secured by real estate and a higher education and are both underwater for millions of Americans, with the value of the property and education worthless than the amount owed to the banks.

Apparently, I also borrowed money from this lender from XXXX through XXXX while attending XXXX XXXX University. It was my belief this loan money was all through XXXX XXXX and a federally-backed funding program. Upon graduating from XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX, I started pursuing consolidation options. I consolidated the majority of my loans and now pay those loans through XXXX, which has been a very reasonable lending group. 

However, there is one "" bundle '' of loans labeled the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX that was not eligible for the consolidation, as it was a Private XXXX XXXX loan. This loan now totals {$45000.00} as the total amount owed. At some point, Navient became the servicer of this loan. I started paying Navient regularly in XXXX, XXXX, which is when I obtained full-time employment after XXXX XXXX Upon moving to XXXX XXXX in XXXX, XXXX ( my husband was in the XXXX at the time and assigned a duty station in XXXX XXXX ), I began trying to negotiate with Navient for a lower payment plan, as I did not have a job in XXXX XXXX. Navient 's customer service reps were hostile, rude, and offered no solutions. One rep  went so far as to suggest that I borrow money from my parents. 

After multiple discussions around trying to see how to arrange a payment plan to no avail, I stopped paying Navient as I had no income coming in. Navient reps started calling me 8-10 times a day, including at XXXX XXXX and all through the weekend. I told them to stop contacting me excessively. This was interpreted as a "" Cease Contact '' request and I have not received ANY correspondence from them since that request. No emails ( other than required tax forms ) and no letters. 

On this date, XXXX XXXX, XXXX, I have {$11000.00} past due and have a negative report on my credit, as Navient as filed this as a "" Collection/Charge Off '' on my credit report. The experience of trying to work with them and bring some order to my student debt has been exhausting. As it stands, my credit is destroyed and I have no idea how to approach this group to enter into a reasonable plan. Additionally, interest accrues at an exorbitant rate, so I will likely live with this debt until the day I die. I have several other lenders I work with ( XXXX, NJ XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and while I take issue with some of those lenders as well, they have all been amenable to working with me on a reasonable payment plan.

So I would not pay they allowed me to pay the miss payment and set up my account for debit for the follow ( next ) payment that was due in several days or weeks. This unfortunately has happened again however this time we went almost 2 years with no issues. On XXXX and XXXX 2016 my debit card was flagged for suspicious activity and reissued a new card. That means ACS / XXXX XXXX did not receive a payment for XXXX or XXXX 2016. However they had bank account and routing number info as well in order to make payments. This did not occur and I received a phone call for XXXX dollars. Everytime they call it 's a new large crazy number they know I would not be able to pay.

I asked about the late charges and late payments, with a request to have them removed off the credit report.

1/20/17,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"In XXXX, I attended XXXX ( XXXX ) in XXXX, PA and took out student loans worth approximately {$50000.00}. Upon graduation in XXXX, working as a cook for {$8.00} per hour, Navient insisted I begin to pay back my loans at a rate of {$900.00} per month. As a single mom I could not afford to pay that amount. Every option Navient presented me with for repayment was absurd. One option for interest only loans dropped payments to {$850.00} which I still could not afford. I applied for loan consolidation with Navient, which would have lowered my loan repayment amount. However, my request was denied as a result of my credit. I was baffled because the same company which issued the loans based on my credit now denied me the ability to repay them at a lower rate because of my credit ; which had not declined since the initial loan. Navient stated I did not have a sufficient credit history. I tried to add my husband as a cosigner on the consolidation but was told they did not allow cosigners. Discouraged I talked to a lawyer about bankruptcy but was told it would not apply to student loans. I was left with no other choice except to defer the loans. I decided to go back to school in hope of one day making more money to pay back the loans. In the meantime the loans capitalized and my loan balance grew. It seemed I would never be able to dig myself out of the debt. In XXXX XXXX, because of a gap in school ( I had finished my XXXX and had not began XXXX. ) ; I had to begin repaying the loans. I had worked hard over those few years to build my credit so consolidation would be an option only to find out they no longer consolidated private loans. When Navient said I had to begin repaying they gave me 2 options : principle plus interests payments and interest only payments. After continually explaining I could not afford the {$1400.00} payments I was told there were n't any other options. Miraculously after much determination and pleading I was transferred to a representative with the Rate Reduction Plan. With a prescreening interview I was eligible for the program and payments were {$420.00} per month with an interest rate of 1 %, only to be bumped out of the program a few short months later. Navient did not explain to me with an "" in school '' status, I would be moved out of the program. Once removed from the plan, Navient continued to collect payment at a much high interest rate of 13.25 % ; I was not informed of the change. When I requested a refund, it was denied. I was told I would not be able to rejoin the program until XXXX XXXX which was one year from the initial sign up date and my loans capitalized even more. Once I graduated with a M.A. my payment went up almost $ XXXX monthly. With the program I will still eventually end up back at a {$1400.00} payment after the rate increase each year. I now owe a lot of money in federal loans as well because I had to avoid defaulting on the Navient loans by returning back to school. I am able to pay smaller amounts on the federal loans. I currently pay almost {$600.00} in loans to Navient which is extremely hard on our family. As a military spouse it is difficult to find employment because we move so often but I must continue to pay. In XXXX, I owed {$120000.00} culinary school, I currently owe {$110000.00} not including XXXX ( fed ) for my XXXX and XXXX I must reapply every year and based on my debt to income ratio I have to pay a much higher rate in the future ; there is an automatic % 1 increase regardless of debt to income ratio. Each year calling back for renewal brings a lot stress as Navient representative are rude and exert their authority. I have been threatened to be dropped from the plan for ridiculous reasons.

I have XXXX children, and at the time, I was married, and my spouse was unemployed. Upon finally entering repayment, my original minimum payments were approximately $ XXXX/month. After my spouse returned to full-time employment, this was a payment that our family could afford without being placed into a financial hardship type of situation. However, after 6 months, AES notified me that they were going to be ballooning my minimum monthly payment to over $ XXXX/month ( approximately $ XXXX/month ). I was very clear with AES that, if they took this action on my loans, this would certainly pose a financial hardship for my family, as we could not afford that amount for a minimum payment.

9/27/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Navient reported me as 120 days past due during their process of returning my loans to Dept. of Education. This act along with numerous hits on my credit report almost caused me to not be able to get a job. I ca n't get a car loan because of this reporting. 

I was unemployed for 7 years. Most of this time I was on deferment with Navient. Every 6 weeks or so they would send me an email to let me know it was time to reapply for deferment so that it would not affect my credit. In XX/XX/XXXX, my present employer did a background check on me and said Navient reported me as being 120 days past due. If I had not shown them the XXXX balance from Navient, I would have not gotten this job. 

I did n't get a notice of this transfer from Navient nor was I provided with a way to continue to reapply for deferment. 

After my employer gave me the credit information, I logged into my Navient account and the balance is XXXX and the status was "" Paid by Navient/Dept of Education ''. I was confused by this. It took me 3 more days to find out that CFPB had sued Navient. During this time I suppose Navient just decided to transfer the loans and not provide an alternative method for me to continue to be in deferment. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, I was reported by Navient as being 120 days past due. My math tells me they put me in default 4 months prior to XX/XX/XXXX even though the DOE said the loans were sent back to them starting on XX/XX/XXXX ( the last entry in my Navient account is XX/XX/XXXX ). I do not  understand why Navient did not communicate with me before my credit was destroyed. I also do not understand why they have so many entries on my credit report ( more than 100 entries in a short period of time ). My credit before this, even while I was unemployed, was XXXX. It is now XXXX and XXXX and I ca n't get a car loan so I can get to my new job without getting a ride from a relative. 

I would like to know why Navient reported me as 120 days past due and why so many entries on my credit report. I would also like to know why my Navient account shows "" paid by '' instead of "" transferred '' to DOE. I had to search to find this information. 

Also, it looks like Navient reported me 120 days past due in XX/XX/XXXX, but the loans were not moved back to the DOE until XX/XX/XXXX. 120 days would be about XX/XX/XXXX. By the time XX/XX/XXXX came around my loans were already in default and now I 've had to enter into a rehabilitation program with DOE before I can find another lender to consolidate the loans, which means more interest is going to accumulate. 

I feel it was extremely unfair for Navient to destroy my credit this way. I ca n't get my own apartment or a vehicle because of this issue. All they had to do was tell me how to continue with deferment instead of destroying my credit.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",GA,312XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/27/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2686627

During which time I had just recently XXXX XXXX my daughter and was on a XXXX XXXX back home. I called in to speak with a representative in regards to my repayments on XXXX and spoke with a representative with ID # XXXX. That representative was very friendly and eager to assist me with my repayment. She advised me that since I would be on a fixed income, there was an alternative payment option available to me called the Modified Graduate Repayment Schedule. She advised me that my payment date would be pushed back until XXXX XXXX and I would repay a lower amount, around {$130.00} a month. She applied me for that program and set the expectation for me that my payment would not be due until XXXX. I budgeted accordingly. I received a call from the collections department of XXXX XXXX AES on XX/XX/XXXX, at which time I was first made aware that the program that representative promised I would be able to take advantage of, no longer existed. I was devastated. The collections department told me I had one day from the day that they called me to make a payment or else they would negatively report me to the credit bureaus. I scraped and pulled money from my Mortgage savings to make that payment to prevent negative reporting. On that same day, XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to a supervisor with AES who began a formal complaint againt that representative after she reviewed that call and confirmed that there was in fact, misinformation being given to me in regards to my repayment. The complaint is on record with AES against the representative, but they were not able to share that with me. Unbeknownst to me, this information was since to an internal inbox in AES website in which I was not aware existed and had received no email, mail or phone correspondence, letting me know that the Modification Repayment option that the representative had promised me was no longer a program as of XXXX. I am very upset that their representatives have given me inaccurate, outdated information causing me to begin repayment of this loan under false expectations. Since that conversation, I have been on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX, on a fixed income. I have struggled to keep my student loan paid up at least 30 days within the due date time frame. Because I was given a false expectation as to what my payment would be and when It would be due, I am now playing catch up, barely making payments to this company after taking money out of a fixed income set budget. 
After multiple calls to this organization pleading for an application to another income based program or change of repayment amount, I was told there are no other options to assist me besides a school enrollment forbearance. I even went as far as to request a due date change to a least help me have time to pay my loan obligation back each month around a different due date other than my other bills and I was denied that request on XX/XX/XXXX. 

I also called in on XX/XX/XXXX in regards to an upcoming due date and was told by a representative, ID # XXXX, that I could pay my bill by XXXX, before the first and be able to avoid negative reporting. After making my payment on XXXX, early morning, I was given a negative on XX/XX/XXXX on my credit report from AES,  stating I did not make a payment on XX/XX/XXXX and it was therefore reported on XX/XX/XXXX. I am desperately seeking some form of assistance. I feel as though as a borrower, I began repayment of this loan under false information and have since been playing catch up and not given a fair opportunity to be a good standing, borrower. I am now being negatively reporting after I paid on the date a representative advised me to pay. Please assist me with getting the negative report of 30 days late as of XX/XX/XXXX removed as the payment confirmation is attached as well as helping me to escalate the issue of the first representative I came in contact with at AES giving me false repayment information.

4/15/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Need information about your loan balance or loan terms,"In XX/XX/XXXX I graduated XXXX XXXX XXXX University with approximately XXXX dollars of student loan debt. None of this debt is private all is both Federal and State ( California ) loans. I had done Forbearance and Deferments while I was in between employment an not making substantial enough money to pay back my loans and the cost of living. In XX/XX/XXXX/XX/XX/XXXX I  consolidated the loans and began paying my student loans back ( I have tax documentation supporting this ). In XX/XX/XXXX I became pregnant and lost my employment ; However, my loans payments were paid through XX/XX/XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX the California housing market and coupled with my husbands loss of bonuses this left us very little money for expenses. Then in XX/XX/XXXX my husband lost his employment. My husband was on unemployment, we had Californias XX/XX/XXXX Insurance, were on XXXX, and were on forbearance for our home loan. I had exhausted all Deferments and Forbearance options and was told there was nothing I could do, absolutely nothing and my loan would go to default. In late XX/XX/XXXX I began getting phone calls from New York Higher Education Services Corporation ( HESC ) both myself and my husband received these calls. In XX/XX/XXXX we attempted to work with HESC they would not send any documentation. HESC would only speak to you on the phone. When you called HESC or attempted to return a call you could never get ahold of them and speak to the same person. HESC expected me to agree only by phone call ( not signed legal documentation ) to have access to me and my husbands social security to have all access to the IRS. HESC would further not let me set up a payment plan I could afford ( we are still paying off bills from my husbands loss of employment never declaring bankruptcy ). HESC only gave me two options pay over XXXX dollars a month or XXXX dollars a month, I had no other options HESC only gave me two. If I chose the XXXX dollar a month choice ( which I did ) HESC guaranteed me with in one year I would be in good standing and they would contact me to renegotiate my loan. HESC did all of this via phone calls NEVER sending or giving me legal and formal documentation. HESC took my joint bank account information and charged my bank account XXXX dollars a month which was paid from XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX. HESC never contacted me as they stated ( why would they there was no legal binding documentation ). In XX/XX/XXXX they contacted me stating they sold my loan and I never paid on, so it was back HESC in default. Again, I was never contacted by another loan company and nor did I ever receive any documentation. No one ever sent me lender change notification, I receive absolutely nothing. Again, both my husband and I demanded they send legal documentation with loan information, principle owed information, interest information and interest owed, etc. We also requested HESC send us formal paperwork justifying their legitimacy, and loan and loan options from them in writing. HESC refused to do or provide anything. In XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX they took our federal tax refunds totally approximately XXXX dollars. I have only ever received Demand Letters from HESC. That is, it and Im am not sure what interest rate my loan has, but its preposterously outrageous. On these following dates these are my totals from different Demand Letters the only formal correspondence HESC seems to mail out. 
1. XX/XX/XXXX HESC stated I owed XXXX dollars 2. XX/XX/XXXX HESC stated I owed XXXX dollars 3. XX/XX/XXXX HESC stated I owed XXXX dollars 4. XX/XX/XXXX HESC stated I owed XXXX dollars 5. XX/XX/XXXX HESC stated I owed XXXX dollars On XX/XX/XXXX I was sent a Demand Letter by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX a collection company for my student loans that stated I owed the following : 1. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX stated I owed XXXX dollars 2. XX/XX/XXXX XXXX stated I owed XXXX dollars 3. XX/XX/XXXX Performant stated I owed XXXX dollars On XX/XX/XXXX I contacted and Attorney specializing in Student Loans ; However, they do not have the ability to negotiate on Federal loans. The Attorney agreed that the way some Federal Student Loan lenders are set up they take advantage of people and the US Department of Education does nothing or does not know there is foul play. The Attorney suggested I contact the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and send letters of debt validity.

4/4/17,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Need information about my balance/terms,"I called my Student Loan company Navient today because I wanted to ask about how to pay off my loan in full. I needed to also turn off my automatic payment which would come out of my bank on the XX/XX/XXXX to avoid over payment. I was told I would need to shut off my auto pay online only. I said I would send in the full amount for XXXX private loans adding up to over {$19000.00}. I was told I needed to sign in online. I just wanted address so my bank could send the payment correctly. 

I am on XXXX and have a lump sum settlement from my XXXX. Anyways when I checked online, it shows my federal loans paid off which is correct but my private loans are no where to be found. I have a XXXX balance with Navient. What my loans are being moved? No contact, not even told this on the phone. 

So how do I get the loans paid off, I do not want those automatic payments coming out of my account I notified them in time to stop them before the XX/XX/XXXX. I want to be done with this craziness. Ugh! Hate this company, horrible to work with, horrible customer service. Was never like this with XXXX. Can you help me find my loans? I am sure you will be better help they their are! I have another small XXXX with another company XXXX something or another for just over {$700.00}. I sure hope I can pay that off with out a hassle. I just want to pay it off so that my XXXX income can just go to meds, doctor bills, food, and XXXX rent. Imagine this I want to pay them completely off and they did not have the decency to tell on the phone they have been moved elsewhere? No go fight with their horrible website to then find out that you can not shut off the automatic payment. Guess I am calling the credit unit to stop the transfers. Horrible company. 

P.S. My father is retired XXXX, and a co-signer. He took me back in when I became too sick with XXXX 's XXXX. I just want to break free from these loans so that they do not impact his retirement or credit.

4/11/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"When Navient became my loan servicer, I agreed on an income-based plan paying {$210.00} per month. The person tried repeatedly to get me to agree to forbearance, which I had already done ( and it added a considerable sum to my debt ). At any rate, the agent instructed me to go to the Navient website, make my first payment, and then set up for auto pay. I did as instructed, adding my bank information in the tab that says "" autopay. '' Since the first payment was manual, it was debited from my account, but the following two months, no payment was taken ; but they were sure to add late fees and a past due balance of {$430.00}. I called to inquire about this and the first thing the agent did was try to get me to agree to forbearance. I declined and said that they were supposed to have debited me for the last two months but did not. The agent proceeded to tell me that I was not signed up for auto pay. While on the call, I went to my Navient account and confirmed that my bank information was in the "" autopay '' tab on the website. He then said I had n't really signed up for auto pay, and he would email me some PDF files that I would have to fill out. When I received these, they were not web-hosted PDF forms that one can fill out, but rather only completable by printing and mailing or faxing, for which no instructions were included. Furthermore, the terms and legalese in the auto pay application were pages long, so long and complex that I was afraid I was committing to something that would cost me additional money. The original agent I spoke with never mentioned this lengthy process. In fact, he just said, "" go to the site, make your first payment, and then set up auto pay and you 're good to go. '' There is no mention on the "" autopay '' tab on Navient.com that mentions downloading and filling out multiple pages of auto pay application. When other companies do autopay, it 's a simple matter of entering your bank info and checking a box to approve. Now I 'm getting daily emails offering forbearance, and was getting daily phone calls and texts before I told them they ca n't do it any more. All I want is for them to make my account up to date and let me pay the agreed amount, but they wo n't do it. 

Also, why do I owe {$49000.00} on a loan with original principal of {$20000.00}? Is this legal?",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",WA,980XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/12/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2430585
12/29/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I previously filed a complaint against MyGreatLakes.org, the company that the Federal Dept. of Education assigned to manage my loan.

There is nothing in it for these private companies to assist borrowers with loan forgiveness as they make Monty from the interest collected. The loans are not like any other fair practice loan program terms that a sane, educated consumer would agree. 
My repayment plan amount was to have increased to {$280.00} in XXXX, XXXX. However, XXXX increased my payment to {$300.00}, in XXXX, without consulting me. When I contacted them, I was informed they needed to do that so the loan would be paid off on time. In addition, my payment due date keeps changing without notice, it was and has been the XXXX of the month. 
I also question their algorithm for payment application bc they applied all payments I made between XXXX and XXXX to interest. It isnt the first time. I think there should be an audit of these loan administrators because they are likely the same kind of lenders that are considered predatory for students applying for student loans. 
Each time they arbitrarily change the payment, the due date changes as well. 
It is bad enough that my original loans in the amount of $ XXXX ballooned up to $ 54K in 7 years when I consolidated and then again almost doubled after consolidation despite making payments. My Pell Grants, Perkins And Stafford Loans combined to this total amount of over $ 90K, and MGL considers all of the amount principal. Ridiculous! 
I worked in the XXXX sector for over 6 years and qualify for the Public Service loan forgiveness except the XXXX time had to occur after XXXX. As a single mother I couldnt afford to work in the XXXX  sector after XXXX. 
This company isnt transparent, there is never any end to their shady payment application and total lack of respect for the customer. The government has given them carte blanche to make as much money as they want to collect on student loans.

9/14/16,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Having problems with customer service,"On or about XXXX XXXX XXXX, my daughter submitted a loan application with Sallie Mae in the amount of $ XXXX to cover the school expenses for her trade school ( XXXX XXXX - XXXX ) that were not otherwise covered through FAFSA. On that same date, I co-sign the loan application and it was submitted back to Sallie Mae for processing. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, my daughter contacted Sallie Mae and found that her loan application was denied on the basis of the co-signer denial. I went out to the Sallie Mae site and saw the denial without explanation ; so, as instructed by their site, I contacted their Customer Service department ( XXXX XXXX ) and spoke with "" XXXX ''. He confirmed the status of the loan application denial, but could not provide an explanation because their "" process '' does not allow their Customer Service personnel from viewing said information ( Oddity # 1 ). He did put in a request through their automated system to generate an explanation letter and that I would see it within 24-48 hours. 

On XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was notified via email that the loan denial explanation was out on the Sallie Mae site in my account ( I have a previous relationship with them due to co-signing student loans for my son ). I download the explanation letter and it was the standard boiler plate denial letter without a clear reason for denial ... just listed the potential reasons. Since my credit standing is very good at this point, even better than it was when I co-signed loans with them for my son, I was very confused ; so, as instructed in their letter, I contacted their Customer Service department again. Again, the Customer Service representative could not help me, so she patched me through to the Originator Department and I spoke with "" XXXX ''. XXXX reviewed the account information ; and, as it was with the Customer Service personnel, he was unable to view the actual reason for the denial and stated that this was the process and policy per their Corporate Headquarters. He did submit a request for a full explanation letter to be sent to me via snail mail and that I would see it within the next 30 days. The problem is that my daughter 's school begins in less than 60 days and I explained I could not wait that long, but he said their was no one else he could refer me to expedite the help request. 

I believe the only reason that is causing the hiccup with this loan application is the outstanding $ XXXX in loans I 've co-sign for my son with Sallie Mae, but none of them are delinquent. I state this because my credit is very good, I have no delinquencies and I have a decent income ( $ XXXX ), plus I 'm a veteran and still currently employed by the XXXX XXXX XXXX ( 20 years XXXX XXXX, 16 years XXXX ). 

My daughter will be resubmitting her applicable using her grandfather and/or aunt to co-sign for her and those should go through with ease, but I am not satisfied with the multiple layered bureaucracy and the fact that XXXX and XXXX XXXX representatives of Sallie Mae can not assist a customer with a simple task, especially one that could possibly be resolved over the phone.

11/14/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I have a very large student loan on the income based repayment plan with plans to request writeoff in 10 years as I work for a nonprofit. Every summer, I am asked to submit income information to reset the loan amount based on that year 's income. Each time, I am forced into several months of back and forth with the loan company to get the amount reset correctly, and my loan is temporarily put into forbearance because the student loan agency is taking so long to process my documents. This year, it has gotten so bad i felt compelled to make a complaint. I started the process in late XXXX. My loan was forced into almost 6 months of forbearance because the student loan agency has been misdirecting me, and has made the process so complicated it is beyond reason. 

I initially turned in my taxes and asked them to readjust the loan for my new income and it came back with an amount of over {$1000.00}, which is just astounding. That is more in disposable income than i have each month. I called back in and got directions on a different way to fill out the form. I asked at that time and still dont understand ... why cant you just check a box telling them to find the lowest payment and tell you what that is? Why do i have to call numerous times each year and ask them to look at it again before they finally come back with the lowest payment??? 

During the second call, I was told over the phone how to complete the form differently and that based on the operator 's estimate, payments would then be {$500.00} due to an unpublished explanation about how to report my income. Okay. So that was more in line what I expected. However ... .Several weeks later I learned, It didnt work again. I had to call again and get different instructions about a box to check. 

It finally worked, but THEN it just stalled in process. I called several times over two months time to ask them to expedite service. FINALLY ... ..they agreed to expedite service. They told me I had to wait a few more weeks, then pay them {$20.00}, then once they received THAT payment i had to wait a month before they would recalculate the loan??? I dont understand on what planet this is a reasonable practice ... I finally got THAT back and now have received two different letters ... one stating my  payment was due XX/XX/XXXX for {$460.00} and another letter the next day stating my loan payment was {$520.00} and it started in XX/XX/XXXX. There is NO EXPLANATION of why there is a difference between these two letters and I am on hold again ( over an hour so far, hung up on twice after sitting on hold over 25 minutes the most recent time ) as I write this letter. All told they now have an additional 6 months worth of interest from me, and I am sucked into another 6 months of payments into this loan. At this rate, it will take me 20 years to reach the 10 year forgiveness plan due to them putting my loan on forbearance every summer. This is absolutely unfair and out of my control. I am not happy and I want help fighting this practice!! 

The process is so confusing and unreasonable that it is clearly to give the loan company the advantage of getting more interest and has NOTHING to do with helping the customer. This needs to be stopped.
I am attaching the last two letters I receieved, one day apart, with two different payment amounts and two different payment start dates, with no explanation as to why the payment amount changed in that 24 hour period, and again, six months after i started the yearly process to readjust my loans based on income.",,AES/PHEAA,WA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,11/14/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2728333

I was never once warned of the rights I was about to give up by turning my Federal Student Loan over to SoFi as a XXXX veteran. That should have been an immediate red flag for the representative to make me aware of that fact. They did, however, threaten me with an increased rate if I didnt make a decision quickly. I felt pressured and rushed to give them an answer. I was told about a month after signing the contract, as expected, I was assessed for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX by the XXXX XXXX. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX, but now SoFi states that I have given up my rights to student loan forgiveness. 

After I received XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX, I called SoFi to inquire about the process on how to apply for federal student loan forgiveness, they told me that I was ineligible. After several phone calls and denials, I reported them to the Better Business Bureau in XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi replied with this statement : The applicant applied for a Student Loan Refinance on XX/XX/XXXX, all necessary underwriting was completed by XX/XX/XXXX. SoFi placed a call to the applicant on XX/XX/XXXX advising his loan acceptance packet was ready to sign. When SoFi makes an outbound call to advise a loan is available to sign, the SoFi representative encourages the Applicant to review the document before signing. In section 3.C of the Loan Acceptance Document, the loss of loan forgiveness benefits is outlined. It identifies specific individuals as follows borrowers pursuing careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces. As a private lending corporation, SoFi does not participate in Federal Loan Forgiveness programs. 

They used the portion of the contract that stated borrowers pursuing careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces. This did n't pertain to me because it pertains to someone "" pursuing '' these professions. I completed my service to my country over 10 years before I applied for this refinancing and did n't plan to pursue careers in Public Service, Teaching and/or the Armed Forces in the future.

They hide behind contract verbiage that does n't pertain to Veterans whose service was honorably completed several years before applying for this loan. 
If I was not deceived and threatened by the salesman with losing the loan, I would have waited the 3 months that it took to get my decision from Veterans Affairs. I did not have any reason to rush refinancing my loan.

Here is my complaint. Great Lakes is in violation of the FAIR DEBT COLLECTIONS PRACTICES ACT ( FDCPA ). 

I have requested that Great Lakes provide me with an original version of the Master Promissory Note in its complete and original form for a debt that they claim I owe them. I have requested this item via certified mail with return receipt, fax with receipt, email, and phone calls. My first communication was sent on XXXX. They have sent me a copy of a signature page with a signature that looks like my signature, but I do not recognize the document nor do I remember ever signing it. The rest of the document is missing. Great Lakes cant find any of it except the page with the signature. Basically they have one sheet with a signature and no pages with any identifiable details on it. They are trying to make me pay them over {$7000.00} with a promissory note that is missing sections A-D and has no identifiable data with it or any terms to an agreement. They refuse to send a letter of deletion to the bureaus even though they do not have a complete contract and the paper that they do have, does n't have any details like address, DOB, Social Security Number, Name of School Attended, Loan Amount, ect.  They only have a page with a signature. 

I am asking for help because I feel like this business has violated the FDCPA by not providing sufficient documentation and not removing the account from my credit report after I have sent various requests in several forms for them to either provide sufficient proof of the debt or remove the account. Instead they have decided to stick to their guns and claim that the page they sent me is sufficient proof. I have sent the page of the promissory note that they sent me. They have told me that they do not have the rest of the contract. I spoke with an attorney today and showed them the document and the attorney told me that the page they sent me is a legal document but it would not hold up in court because it does n't have any information or terms. I have repeatedly asked for the rest of the document and they have repeatedly refused to do anything. I have a ton of documentation of my conversations with them in the form of certified letters, fax, phone, email, and etc. I have attached just a few to give you an idea of what I 'm dealing with. 

Please help me resolve this matter and clear my name and my credit worthiness. If you need anymore details, then please ask.

Even though this debt was XXXX, the federal student loan corporation kept harassing me to make payments on it and accept the debt. At the time, I was working as a XXXX for the federal government and was afraid it would impact my career, so I opted to pay on the loan to stop the constant harassment. This was the era when there were very few to no consumer protection rights regarding debt collector harassment tactics. Even the XXXX XXXX XXXX utilized many debt harassment tactics that would be considered unjust and illegal in todays world. 

Over the years, I made payments and at certain periods of time the account went into a deferred status and I stopped making payments for a period of time after my lawyer told me that this debt was fully XXXX in bankruptcy court and that I should not have been making any payments to the XXXX XXXX XXXX or any other entity claiming to own this account. This account eventually fell into a default status and that is when the XXXX XXXX XXXX  brought in XXXX XXXX XXXX to aggressively go after the garnishment of my wages. 

I elicited the help of a lawyer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to represent me to the XXXX XXXX XXXX  regarding the aggressive tactics taken by XXXX  XXXX XXXX and their attempt to garnish my wages. After in-depth research into my case, my lawyer crafted a letter that explained how the bulk of the original student loan was dischargeable under Bankruptcy XXXX XXXX see attached letter ) and that XXXX  XXXX should not have been allowed to garnish my wages. 

Navient acquired this account from XXXX which in turn took it over from an aggressive and now defunct debt collector named XXXX XXXX XXXX who were hired by the XXXX XXXX XXXX to garnish my wages as previously mentioned.

I have provided them documentation showing that I have paid this account in full, however they refuse to acknowledge the documents I have provided nor do they respond to any requests for an audit of this account. 

In addition, Navient is actually being more underhanded and fraudulent with this account by adding onto the balance the unsubstantiated unpaid interest that they supposedly inherited from XXXX.

5/2/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"I have been swallowing my pride for far too long, but now my back is against the wall and I feel as though I have no where left to turn. The reason I need help is because of my student loans. I know what you're going to say -- '' everyone has student loans! '' and although that's true, I've buried myself in a larger hole than most. A predatory lender and my school are both to blame for preying on a my nativity. Lets rewind to XX/XX/XXXX. I just graduated from XXXX XXXX high school with a graduating class off XXXX. I grew up in a small town with big dreams of becoming a XXXX. I lived for making sick XXXX XXXX  of my friends and my XXXX  collection was extremly impressive for a XXXX year old. I would spend hours XXXX  and XXXX XXXX  that I was proud of. I knew the only way to progress was to further my education in college. I decided to attend XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX. During my first visit, I was in awe. It was a potential playground for my imagination and skills to grow ( plus the school was partially owned by XXXX XXXX XXXX, so it seemed too good to be true! ). I knew it would be expensive, but I figured it was a good investment for my future. And When I finally landed that dream job that XXXX promised to help me find, my student loans would be no problem. I ended up borrowing a {$50000.00} private student loan from Navient ( you ) for a 2 year education, because that's that only loan options XXXX accepted. It seems like a lot but it was all for a school that promised me the world. During my years and XXXX, I slept of the floor in my friend 's apartment. I ate XXXX XXXX XXXX day old bread with free mustard and ramen noodles every day. It all seemed worth it when I graduated with excellent grades. I felt a sense of accomplishment for being the first in my family to complete a degree. When it was time to venture out into the real world, the potential jobs XXXX promised to help me find were nothing more than entry level minimum wage jobs. I was offered a minimum wage job to be a XXXX XXXX in a costume at their park. I knew that was not going to help me progress in my chosen field let alone pay the bills. I ended up landing a internship on my own accord at a XXXX XXXX. When my student loans started rolling in, they didn't seem so terrible initially. The first payment was {$200.00} for the month, then the next {$250.00}. They kept getting progressively higher until they reached {$2500.00} a month. My internship was ending and I scrambled to figure out what to do next. I found the first job I could at a XXXX XXXX  until I could figure out my next move. I called Navient to figure out what the heck was going on and why my payments kept going up. The interest on this loan was INSANE. I didnt know how loans worked when I initally signed my life away. I had no idea that all student loans were not created equal. I pleaded with them for payment options. Could I extend the amount of time to pay back my loan? Are there any income driven payment plans? What about federal student loan forgiveness programs? All of those questions were quickly shot down with a no. Although Navient ( you ) did tell me I could magically freeze my account with a forbearance by joining the military. They did fail to mention it would still accrue interest during the time is was frozen. With little options and time running out, I signed my life away to the military that same week to make my problems temporarily go away. That has been my life for the past 5 years. I made a huge, life altering decision because I was bullied into doing so. I knew I couldn't run forever and this is starting to finally catch up to me. I knew little about the loans I was borrowing. Because they are PRIVATE student loans, they don't qualify for federal forgiveness programs. And because they are private STUDENT loans, I can't get out of paying for them even if I declare bankruptcy. So I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. To rub more salt into the wound, I can not continue my education because all the credits acquired at XXXX are utterly useless. They we're an unaccredited school during the time I went. Absolutely no institution of higher education will recognize the credits I supposedly earned. To make matters worse they are now accredited and accept FAFSA. At the time I went, I was assured that accreditation did not matter because how how "" prestigious '' there school is. What a load of XXXX. I feel ashamed I let Navient and XXXX take advantage of my younger self. As a kid I was always told college was the way to go so I just assumed I was doing everything right. The worst of it all is that I no longer have the passion and drive I once did for the craft I truly loved. I have made many calls, spoken to lawyers, and I'm finally at wits end. over the past 5 years my loan has jumped from {$50000.00} to nearly {$80000.00}. Starting this XX/XX/XXXX, I will have to pay {$1000.00} a month for the next 15 years making it close to {$150000.00} owed. Thats over 1/3 of my paycheck every month. There is a law that prohibits lenders from charging XXXX XXXX military more than 6 % on any loan, so if I leave the military sooner than 15 years, that could make that {$150000.00} closer to {$200000.00}. I simply can not afford it. If I default on my loans, they can take everything from me. My house, my car, and my credit. This jeopardizes me and my family and I am beyond grateful to any of my friends and family who can help me in any way they can. Although I joined the military out of desperation, I do love my country and I have had a rough yet fulfilling 5 years. I have endured gruling deployments, and sacrificed time with my loved ones. I have grown so much as an adult. I pay my bills, set budgets and don't splurge on things I don't need. I wish so badly that I could go back in time and tell my bright-eyed younger self to not trust the school that once promised me so much. We live and we learn, but some actions have greater consequences than others and this is something that could really demolish my future.

I was put on FMLA,  unpaid leave, at my employment, XXXX, XXXX. I was forced to resign my employment on XX/XX/XXXX, due to not having a definitive timeline to be able to return to work. Based on my credit report, I paid, or was current on payments with these loans between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, despite Navient quoting yesterday, "" you managed to pay other bills, but ignored paying us ''. I saw my third XXXX, which is XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX VA XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX, with my next appointment on XX/XX/XXXX. I was officially released to work/find work on XX/XX/XXXX, by XXXX XXXX. I have not paid any credit cards since XXXX. I had some monetary help from family and friends to try to keep my vehicle insurance, health insurance, cell phone, and apartment current ( to include utilities ). I also had XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, and released to work by that doctor mid XX/XX/XXXX, but was not released by XXXX as of yet. I went through XXXX XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, while currently waiting on the VA to approve more XXXX XXXX. I have applied to Social Security XXXX, in XX/XX/XXXX, and Supplemental Income, in XX/XX/XXXX. I have applied for VA XXXX XXXX, in XX/XX/XXXX, and Pension in XX/XX/XXXX. I do not have any temporary or permanent XXXX insurance. I could not get unemployment insurance between XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX, due to "" not being able to work ''. I was denied unemployment insurance in XXXX, due to "" lose of job through no fault of my own '', since I resigned, instead of getting terminated or laid off. I appealed the decision, but the judge ruled that I am denied unemployment insurance. 

Sorry this is so long, but I wanted to show what I have been through the last 6+ months. I was angry and XXXX the entire month of XX/XX/XXXX, which is one reason I was not able to return to work. I have not had an income since XX/XX/XXXX. I had to break my apartment lease on the closing of XX/XX/XXXX, which I owe over {$1200.00}. I had to break my cable subscription in XXXX, which I owe over {$600.00}. I have many medical bills that are unpaid, and are now in collections. I owe XXXX 's, complaint filed on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX ), over {$3200.00}. My cell phone was suspended on XX/XX/XXXX, which I owe over {$600.00} plus payments on devices still owed, to XXXX XXXX XXXX. My bank account was closed, due to negative funds for over 60 days. I was able to return to military duties after XX/XX/XXXX for the XXXX XXXX XXXX. Everything I earned in XXXX went to military debt payments, and the negative funds in my bank. I was able to payoff my negative funds in XXXX and open a new account with my drill pay. I have received my federal income tax, which I am living off of at the moment. I had to spend over {$400.00} on vehicle parts to fix my vehicle, that I had to struggle to change myself for lack of funds. I was also able to switch my cell phone to XXXX in XXXX. I explain all of this information every time that I call and speak with Navient, but they insist that I have enough income to pay them every month. They constantly threaten me with default, now the loans will go into default XX/XX/XXXX per the customer service supervisor I spoke to yesterday. 

The supervisor belittled me saying "" it's my fault that I can not get a job, not hers ''. She would constantly argue with me about what I would tell her. She questioned everything I said about my situation like I was lying to her. Almost every time myself or my Co-borrower speaks with Navient, we are ensued in an argument, like we are lying and just trying not to pay the loan. I would love to be able to pay the loan, so that I can get rid of the loan. I would also love to be able to pay all my other bills too!!! Yes, Navient has helped me in the past, but it usually took multiple phone calls to speak with someone that would actually care to help. It was not explained to me that there was only 24 months of forbearance time. Forbearance was always the solution Navient would give me, instead of lowering my payments. The loan was almost in default the last time I needed help. And then all I was asking was to lower my payments 20 %, since I was cut 20 % of my hours at work, due to the current XXXX slow down at the time, for which I "" misspoke '' on the previous complaint saying "" I luckily found a job a few weeks later, but I am not cut 20 % of my pay do to the current XXXX  glut. '' That statement should of read, "" I luckily found a job a few weeks later, but I am now cut 20 % of my pay do to the current XXXX  glut. '' I told Navient yesterday that I only receive about {$280.00} after deductions and taxes from my XXXX XXXX pay. My cell phone bill is {$120.00}, due to having to purchase a phone also, since I did not have one to use with XXXX. My vehicle insurance is {$55.00}. That's a total monthly expense of {$180.00}. Which leaves me with {$100.00} for gas that will take me 2 hours away to XXXX XXXX for doctors appointments, any interviews that I finally get for jobs, and getting to my military unit for monthly drill duty. I currently live with my father and step-mother, who are living check to check, dealing with their own medical bills and expenses. My father will pay for my gas to get to doctors appointments, interviews, and drill, if I do not have the money, and only if I spent the money on my cell phone and vehicle insurance. If I were to start paying loans instead of my bills, I will not receive help from my father, and will still be in the same situation I am in now. It's a lose lose situation, until I can start working. And even after I start working, I will have to get another apartment, and get utilities setup again. After I finally get a job again, I will still probably need two to three months to be financially stable enough to start paying loans again. I tried to  explain to Navient that they are not the only company I can not pay. Navient told me to pay them, and figure out how to pay my cell phone, vehicle insurance, and gas after that! The supervisor told me that my bills are not her problem, the loan is. When I asked about working for Navient, she told me to see if there are any jobs open in my area, well of course I don't live near any Navient jobs, so she said I being condescending. I explained to her that they may have telework that I can do, and that's why I asked about jobs. She also told me that any company that I am in default with will not hire me anyway.

1 ) That does not make any sense to me, since hiring someone that owes you money could guarantee a payment on the loan.

2 ) I do not fall into default until XX/XX/XXXX, per that same supervisor. 

I also have to explain the entire situation every single time that I call. I'm beginning to wonder if the customer service associates are even entering notes on my account.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",LA,703XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2/27/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2827589

Who can be of assistance in regards to this issue. 

Thank you.

XX/XX/XXXX, the owners of XXXX XXXX XXXX filed for Bankruptcy under Chapter XXXX and I was settled with a significant amount of student loan debt for training I had not yet received. I was told by the Bankruptcy court that through Chapter XXXX Bankruptcy, no action could be taken against the owners and that private student loans could not be forgiven through bankruptcy. At this time we also learned that the school was not bonded as required, and that the State had been investigating the company for some time now. They had little to no assets.

I was given no account information to view my loans online, and even when I tried to track this information down online by entering other personal information, like Social Security number, birthdate, first and last name, their online system could not link me to any account ( which I find odd considering almost every other banking institution can retrieve your account information from your personal information filled out in your account applications ). 

Having never taken out student loans previously, I was not completely understanding of how the process worked. Since my loans were then issued and distributed through XXXX University 's financial aid office, I did n't suspect any issues or negligence on the part of the bank. 

My loans will soon fall out of their grace period next month, and after having still not been contacted by Wells Fargo, I called to find out any information. In speaking with several loan service officers, I learned I DO in fact have an account number, which had never been given to me through any correspondence.

I was never emailed nor mailed ANY statements notifying me of quarterly interest payments, which I could have been making ( and DID make on my federal loans ) during school. 

I have now accrued nearly {$10000.00} in interest that I was never notified of, and the bank accepts culpability for mailing loan disclosure agreements to the wrong address and for also failing to EVER correspond with me through email so that I could access my online account. 

I understand from the XXXX XXXX XXXX 's XX/XX/XXXX article ( XXXX ) that Wells Fargo has been under investigation by the CFPB, so I am submitting my case to help further this investigation.

My income is very low and I ca n't afford to hire a lawyer and do n't know where to go to file a complaint or get answers.

1/13/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"I have had ongoing issues both with getting my XXXX loan forgiveness amount of {$5000.00} taken off my account after being approved and with recalculating my payment amount under the REPAYE option after a significant change in income. 

In regards to the XXXX loan forgiveness program. I have 5 years of documented XXXX in XXXX XXXX XXXX and have submitted the necessary paperwork which has since been approved for loan forgiveness. However, it has been over 6 months since the paperwork was deemed complete and according to their representatives, approved. Yet, a "" computer glitch '' supposedly denied the amount be taken off my account after it was approved. They then tried to put me on administrative forbearance again as they resubmitted the request, which has in turn lessened my qualifying payments toward public service loan forgiveness. 

In terms of my monthly payment calculation, I have provided alternative income certification twice this past year because of two changes in income not represented on my tax AGI. The first one was processed accurately and the second one was initially processed accurately and then recalculated even though I did not ask for a recalculation and is over triple what they initially sent me as the new payment. The new recalculation does not match up with what the student loan repayment calculation or my pay stubs would determine as my estimated payment. I asked them to resubmit it for recalculation after a representative told me that the new calculation was incorrect. It came back with the same exorbitant amount they had previously recalculated. 

XXXX Loan Forgiveness Timeline XX/XX/XXXX I submitted my first application and it was subsequently denied because I the form submitted by one XXXX district was missing the title of that XXXX that signed it, the XXXX district was deemed ineligible because the XXXX had used the XXXX name of "" XXXX XXXX XXXX '' instead of "" XXXX XXXX '' as it appeared on the Title I list, and was submitted prior to the close of the 5th XXXX year I had worked. 

XX/XX/XXXX I resubmitted the application for XXXX loan forgiveness with the corrections made to the XXXX name, the date showing the completion of the 5th XXXX year, and the XXXX 's title listed next to her name. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notice that my application for XXXX  loan forgiveness as deemed complete and eligible and that the request would be passed on to the Department of Education. 

XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX placed my account on administrative forbearance without known cause. This meant that I was not making payments that would count toward public loan forgiveness during this time. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX placed my account on administrative forbearance again without known cause. This meant that I was not making payments that would count toward public loan forgiveness during this time. It was later described to me that this forbearance was placed on the account because of the processing of my XXXX loan forgiveness paperwork. However, this information was verbal and not given in the letter regarding the placement of the forbearance. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX placed my account on administrative forbearance again without known cause. This meant that I was not making payments that would count toward public loan forgiveness during this time. It was later described to me that this forbearance was placed on the account because they had to resubmit my XXXX loan forgiveness paperwork for approval ( even though it had been previously approved according to their records ). This time, I pushed to speak to a supervisor and requested that the forbearance be removed from my account so that I could continue making qualifying payments toward public service forgiveness. 

Income Based Repayment Calculations XX/XX/XXXX Annual recertification due. Upon consolidation, my payment had been calculated based on our AGI from our tax transcripts. When asked to recertify, we provided alternative income verification as our income had significantly changed from the amount on our most current taxes due to a change in my spouses income. 

XX/XX/XXXX Payment was recalculated to be {$150.00} based on the alternative income verification provided. It is important to note that I have only made one payment of this amount because of the administrative forbearance placed on my account starting XX/XX/XXXX. I made a payment for XX/XX/XXXX while my application for a recalculation was being made because of a change in job and drop to nearly half of the previous income demonstrated back in XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I submitted the application and necessary pay stubs to have my payment recalculated since it had come off forbearance and we had a significant change in income not demonstrated in our tax transcript. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notification that my monthly payment under the RePAYE plan had been recalculated to be {$55.00} to begin XX/XX/XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notification via email that my application for an IDR plan had been approved ( I  already had it approved a new payment recalculated XX/XX/XXXX and had not reapplied ). In the email it said my new payment amount would be {$290.00}. However, there was nothing to substantiate this email in my paperless inbox upon sign in. So I called and they agreed to recalculate the payment amount after a representative checked in with the department that processes these applications and they told me that it was a mistake and that the formula did not take into account my family size or other factors which is why it was incorrect. 

XX/XX/XXXX I receive a link in email to a notice in my secure inbox that states that my monthly payment had been recalculated to be {$290.00}. This occurred after the representative I spoke to on XX/XX/XXXX submitted a request to recalculate. I am unsure why the recalculation is the same incorrect amount from the XX/XX/XXXX email. According to the notice, my new payments of {$290.00} are to start on XX/XX/XXXX. 

At this point, my main concern is that my approved teacher loan forgiveness amount of {$5000.00} is deducted form my balance and that my monthly payment amount is recalculated to match the initial notice I received after submitting alternative certification which was {$55.00}. I am also concerned that my public service loan forgiveness qualifying payments are properly demonstrated to include XX/XX/XXXX ( the first payment after the end of forbearance ) and XX/XX/XXXX ( which is being deducted in the amount of {$55.00} as a direct debit but not showing as due on my account because of the cancellation of the new forbearance that they tried to place on my account to resolve the teacher loan forgiveness dilemma ). 

I am including the documents of correspondence at this time because of identifying information related to my account. However, I am happy to provide the paper trail to verify the above timeline of information upon request.",,AES/PHEAA,AK,99829,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,1/13/18,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2780862

I understand of course as they stated this is all my responsibility but with such a significant increase in payment I definitely think a better effort on their side communication wise is definitely warranted.

Nelnet services the discharge process, and at this point I have been approved for that. 
The problem is that they will not refund this payoff that I made out of my XXXX back pay because the state that any payments I made before they were aware of my eligibility are not refundable.

I decided to apply for student loans with Citibank because they were one of the only loan companies that I could get a loan through with my credit and a cosigner. Since graduating XX/XX/XXXX they have sold off some of my loans to XXXX and kept the majority that had very high interest rates. They allowed me to put them in a forbearance for a certain amount of time but once that time was up I was not able to defer them any longer. I had to jump through hoops to get them to put them into a forbearance while I was away for XXXX and would n't have access to electronic devices to be able to pay my bill. I did not get a good job out of college and have struggled thus far to be able to pay the {$430.00} monthly payment that they offer no other payment plan for. This is on top of a {$120.00} payment to discover and almost {$200.00} to federal loans. I fell behind on my payments and they would call me at least XXXX times a day ( from various phone numbers ) starting at XXXX central time and not letting up until XXXX or XXXX. I also received at least one letter a week demanding payment and have a stack, almost an inch thick, of letters from them, my co-signer also received these letters. This was not only stressful and humiliating, but it was also depressing and made me regret ever going and getting a college education. I have recently had to take out a small personal loan to get caught up on the payments, but was unable to even get a loan for more that XXXX dollars because of the negative impact the Citi Student loans had on my credit score. They are unwilling to negotiate a lower payment amount and I ca n't find anyone that would even consider consolidating loans from them. Their associates are much less than pleasant to speak with and leave me feeling like I have no self worth after talking to them.

3/2/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I completed my income recertification and asked to switch from IBR to PAYE. I was told that if the switch to PAYE was approved, I would have one month where I would be put on the standard plan ( with reduced payment forbearance ) and then the following month I would switch to the PAYE plan. In XX/XX/XXXX, I received a bill for {$5.00}, so I assumed that was the month in reduced payment forbearance. I have direct debit set up so I took no action. In XX/XX/XXXX I received another bill for {$5.00}, so I logged into my account because I thought the XXXX payment should have been a PAYE payment. When I logged in, I saw that they had not debited the XXXX payment at all, so I called FedLoan Servicing on XX/XX/XXXX and spoke to Employee XXXX who told me that XXXX should have been an IBR payment, XXXX should have been the reduced payment forbearance, and XXXX should be the PAYE payment. Unfortunately someone at FedLoan Servicing mistakenly placed my account into delinquency forbearance in XXXX ( my account was never delinquent ) and they did n't direct debit the payment because when an account is in any kind of forbearance, the payment can only be manually made ( they never notified me that they would not accept direct debit ). The employee was able to reactivate the XXXX bill ( remove the improper delinquency forbearance ) and have me manually pay the IBR payment amount. He also instructed me to manually pay the XXXX reduced payment forbearance and was able to confirm that I was approved to start they PAYE plan in XXXX with direct debit. I am XXXX military ( on track for PSLF ), so my primary concern was that the XXXX payment should still count as a qualifying payment for PSLF since the error had been caused by FedLoan Servicing. My secondary concern was that because they had not direct debited the XXXX amount as they should have, my interest rate erroneously rose from XXXX % to XXXX %. It took multiple calls ( on XX/XX/2017 I spoke with Employee XXXX ; on XXXX I spoke with Employee XXXX ; and on XXXX I spoke with Employee XXXX ) before I was offered assurance that they would not in my record that the XX/XX/XXXX payment should count toward PSLF, that the XXXX payment was properly adjusted, including the interest rate, and the issue should be ( hopefully ) resolved. The reason I 'm filing the complaint is because this is the 3rd time there was an error with my account ( the first 2 times it did not seem to be standard practice for employees to provide employee ID numbers at the start of calls like they do now ). The first time was when I initially entered XXXX it took several requests before they lowered my interest rate in accordance with SCRA ( and I 'm still not 100 % convinced that the interest rate reduction was made retroactive to the time I entered XXXX ). The second time was in the winter of 2015, they failed to mail me notice that it was time for me to recertify my income, so my payment amount suddenly spiked to the standard repayment amount. When I noticed the astronomical amount pulled from my savings account, I called to several times to fix the error, but they ended up putting my account into forbearance without my permission ( causing me to miss out on two months of qualifying PSLF payments ), increasing my interest rate because they tinkered with my direct debit setup, and providing misleading information about how I should address the issue. It took months before they switched me back to my IBR payment and I still do n't feel they adequately resolved the damage caused by their mistakes. I 'm especially concerned because I am relatively conversant on federal student loan issues and I repeatedly had to tell the people I talked to that their advice to me was coming across as very predatory and I would hate to think they treat all service members who may not be as conversant in the rules they same way that they treated me.",,AES/PHEAA,NV,891XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/2/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,2366053

9/19/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"My student loan servicer is FedLoan Servicing. I have been dealing with them since XXXX when my loan was transferred to them from XXXX XXXX in XXXX due to being on an income-based repayment plan. I have been paying my loans since XXXX. The entire time of repayment, I have worked for employers that qualify under the Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program [ PSLF ] My difficulties with F/edLoan Servicing is that they are unwilling to recalculate PSLF-eligible payments. Again, I have been paying since XXXX and they are only counting 24 payments as being eligible. When I call to get an explanation or to rectify the situation, I get conflicting information. I have yet to hear the same explanation twice which leads me to believe they do not know what they are doing. 

They promise to do a payment recalculation which, they say, takes 60 days to complete. I have never heard back from any of these requests. I have spoken with supervisors who also have promised to do research, follow up and rectify the situation, but there has been no communication or resolution on their end at all. 

They continually send back paperwork that I submit, refuse to answer my online questions about all of this and never follow up. Most recently, I spoke with "" XXXX '' [ extension XXXX ] on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX about all of this and he promised to email me paperwork to fill out as well as source material outlining where FedLoan Servicing gets their information about how PSLF works. I never received the email from him. I left him a voicemail and he never returned my call. 

This treatment has been the norm when dealing with FedLoan Servicing and I believe that they are defrauding a large population of this country into making more payments towards their student loans outside the government PSLF program payment amount of XXXX. By refusing to count payments that clearly qualify, FedLoan Servicing are extending the 120 month payoff to much longer. Their lack of communication or resolution indicate that this is deliberately intended to defraud people. 

Because this agency is the sole student loan servicer dealing with PSLF, I feel that this violates anti-trust laws. This is a monopoly sanctioned by the US Department of Education and there needs to be some serious evaluation on its ethics and handling of student loan debt.
Again, here are my complaints : 1. They refuse to recalculate payments eligible to count towards the 120 month payoff outlined by the Public Student Loan Forgiveness Program.
2. They give wildly contradicting "" information '' about how payments are calculated. Every time I have spoken to an employee, I hear a completely different story. This is no different when speaking with the supervisors.
3. They do not respond to their online "" Contact Us '' nor do they follow up with you when you call. They do not email documentation or links as promised on phone conversations. They repetitively reject paperwork pertinent to my payment status [ they have returned my application for a PSLF-eligible employer 5 times ] and when they finally do accept anything, they mess the dates up in their system which becomes advantageous to them in that they get to subtract PSLF-eligible payments. They say they will fix the situation, but when I check the status of the correction months later, nothing was done. 

I have had enough of this company and will be contacting my senator to complain. There needs to be a massive overhaul of this system to help people in need pay off their student loan debt according to government-led programs such as PSLF.",,AES/PHEAA,WA,983XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/19/17,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2677781

8/19/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"First of all please note I have never in my life filed a formal complaint against anyone or any company. 

We have had a total of 7 student loans with Sallie Mae/Navient beginning in XX/XX/XXXX. We have consolidated or paid off all but 1 loan ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) which has a current balance of over {$43000.00}. We have always made the payments not really monitoring the principle balances. Our most current Statement Dated XXXX XXXX shows the current amount due is {$300.00} and the Current Amount Due date as XXXX XXXX which is 4 months from now. We have from time to time skipped a single payment all together, thinking we were ok because like with this current statement the payment was not due for a month or more. We recently had cause to look back over the XXXX XXXX XXXX loan and realized there were 30 months when the payment went entirely to interest with {$0.00} going to the principle. This loan has had no late fees ever charged. The first time I called Navient many weeks ago about this I was told We had missed or been late on many payments and we were concerned that they couldn't find the confirmation numbers that their system had given us for online payments. However we have never missed a due by date, we frequently pay more than the minimum, and there were never any late fees charged so I don't understand how they can say payments were late. ( There is an XXXX document attached below. ) During the second phone call the representative we were talking to commented it seemed to be a problem that the due dates were being extended. He did explain the interest was accrued daily and how I can see the current interest balance due on the website. I still don't understand how a payment due date is extended into the future without it being a full payment including interest. The interest is accrued daily but isn't factored into a payment that is advanced? So when we occasionally skipped a payment or just delayed a payment because the due date was a month or more in the future the interest was actually piling up and the full payment and extra we thought was going to the principle was actually all going to interest for a total of 2 1/2 years over the life of the loan to date. Furthermore, the frozen principle balances started months before the skipped payment they attributed the problem to in the course of the phone call. We had believed we were dealing with a reputable company. I have to wonder how many other accounts with Navient are experiencing the same misrepresentation. It is completely misleading to the consumer to say a payment is not due until months from now and then allow the interest to continue pilling up and then everything paid is being consumed by the interest balance. That is setting the consumer up with misinformation. IF THE PAYMENT DATE IS BEING ADVANCED IT SHOULD INCLUDE THE INTEREST FOR THAT PERIOD. How does Navient determine how far to advance a payment due date? The original loan consolidation in XXXX was for {$50000.00}. Since then we have paid only {$6900.00} in principle and {$26000.00} in interest on this loan. I now have a better understanding of how this is being manipulated and will definitely be dealing with this differently going forward. There is an awful lot of very small print on the back of the paper statements. The consumer is definitely at risk dealing with this company. We had to go to a different repayment scale a couple of years ago which obviously reduced our principle payment each month. However we have made many payments larger than the required amount due, including during the time that the principle balance was frozen and they put the entire payments to interest. If we hadnt realized what was happening we never would have gotten this paid off. 30 months of payments in the past 7 years have already been all interest even though many of them were for more than the amount due. If we're a month ahead on a car payment or house payment and then have to skip a payment it's no problem. The interest is already part of the payment. Not true with Navient. They say your next payment due is 4 months from now and quietly pile the daily interest onto the loan and all of your future payments go to the interest until that interest is paid off.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",IL,622XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/20/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2995896

7/3/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't temporarily delay making payments,"On XX/XX/XXXX, I started contacting Great Lakes about putting my student loan in deferment. I can not make regular payments and I am in the process of combining 5 student loans into a consolidation status. The consolidation process is long and complicated. Great Lakes it seems did not put my student loan into deferment. So, in XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Great Lakes on their website and with the following letter : This letter is to clear up the confusion with the status of my student loan. Please put it in deferment and keep it there until further notice. This letter will also provide the reasons for the deferment. I have been on the Great Lakes website where I tried to apply for the deferment. The website asked way too many questions which I do not have time for. I have too many problems and not enough time to fill in the blanks on the Great Lakes website. Here are the issues I am dealing with which qualify me for the deferment : My wife and I have five ( 5 ) student loans which we are trying to consolidate. This has been complicated and very time consuming. We will not make any payments to any of them until the consolidation is complete. Due to my time at XXXX and barely having the financing to graduate, we have accumulated a great amount of debt that we are still trying to deal with even to this day. Right as I was graduating, my unemployment benefits dried up and I did not have an income for a while. Due to this, we accumulated a great amount of debt that we are still dealing with : An IRS bill An EDD bill Paying 2 speeding tickets to a collection agency. Cant driveno job and then no money Pawn shop ( 4 pieces of family jewelry ) Chapter XXXX bankruptcy payments  High cell phone bill High electricity bill Rent increase just recently All this means is that we barely live paycheck to paycheck, our credit is shot and we have aging cars that need a lot of repairs and due to our chapter XXXX bankruptcy, we cant get new ones. Both of  our cars are barely running well, both need brake work, both need major tune ups, both cars have registration that is due in XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, both cars need tires, both have cracked front windshields and both have high mileage that increases by the day. Both need major interior work which cant be done without money. If for any reason one of our cars decides to break downwe do not have any money or any means to fix it. No car, no job, no money and we could very well be homeless. We are also in the process of taking care of our daughter who has just XXXX XXXX XXXX. She is in school with no income and we have been paying her bills and taking care of her. Things will be better for her once she gets back to school and can get an income. It has been tough taking care of her and keeping all the bills paid. We just recently had to deal with a {$200.00} overdraft on our checking account. A couple had to be paid which overdrew out account. Once payday hit, the {$200.00} was taken care of. But for a couple of weeks, there was no money and times were really tough. What this all means is we do not have enough to pay even our regular bills, have gas in the cars and food on the table. We barely make it from paycheck to paycheck. This will be this for quite some time until debts are paid off and our incomes increase. Our chapter  XXXX bankruptcy is in effect until XX/XX/XXXX so we are stuck with it and stuck because of it in so many ways. So, the reason for this notice is to fix the missing information on your website that is not asked for. I dont have time to collect all the paperwork and information required to fill in the blanks on your website in the deferment section. Please keep my status in deferment and wait for our consolidation company to contact Great Lakes with instructions of our consolidation of all our student loans. Lastly, please update your website to allow more than 975 characters in the contact section for comments. 975 characters is nowhere near enough to get any points across. <P/>As near as I can tell, Great Lakes still has not put my student loan into deferment.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,GREAT LAKES,CA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,7/13/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2564342

I currently have nearly {$100.00} XXXX in student loans, most of which are private through Navient. Navient also took over my federal loans recently from XXXX, to my regret of course seeing as how they 've handled loans so far. 
When I first looked into attending college, I was pushed by the "" student services '' staff at my University into taking the private loans. At the time I knew nothing of college or finances, but I was assured by them that my struggling parents made too much money and these were the only way to go. What a grave mistake I made. Since then, I have been struggling everyday with this giant financial burden. I did graduate and I continue to make my monthly payments. However, I paid over {$100.00} XXXX for a XXXX of XXXX or XXXX, which did n't help me get a job making nearly enough to pay off the loans. 
When I began reaching out to XXXX, they were very aggressive and would continually push me into asking relatives for money, allocating other bill money like rent to them instead, and into using up all 12 months of allotted forbearance at once, not telling me that they only allow that much time over the life of your loans. I have never had a pleasant experience with Navient and my interest rates continually change. 
Two years ago I was desperate for help and a representative helped me over the phone to extend the life of the loans while bringing my interest down to 2.5 %. She explained that it would be locked in at this rate for the life of the loan if I added on another 10 years to it. I entered the agreement and after only one year, the rates went back up and I was stuck with 10 years on my loan agreement. When I called, they denied the original agreement and told me that the agreement was for only one year. The last time I spoke with them, I asked them if there was any way they could help me and they simply said "" No, there 's nothing we can do for you. '' I have been completely mislead and find it heartbreaking that in one of the greatest countries in the world, we ca n't trust those who claim to have our best interests in mind.

I finished veterinary school in XX/XX/XXXX, and started making payments six months later. During that time period, I was working in a PSLF eligible position with the USDA. I made my payments on time, every month. I changed to a new PSLF eligible position for the University XXXX XXXX with only a one week period of time in between jobs ( equivalent to my accumulated vacation days ). I have recertified at the end of my XXXX employment ( XX/XX/XXXX ), and eligibility is confirmed. However, XXXX 's system only recognizes 5 of those payments. I have been attempting to get this adjusted by calling XXXX. I call XXXX once or twice a month to work on this issue. It has now been over a year, and XXXX operators still tell me that "" it will be fixed, I can see someone working on it now. '' I have certified my employment at the University XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX, I have recertified in XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX has not updated my eligible payments. When I attempt to address this issue with XXXX phone operators, they seem confused and do not understand why the problem is not being worked on. I bring this issue up when I call XXXX once or twice a month. I make my payments on time and in the full amount that is due. I do this every month. 
The money that XXXX tells me is due each month seems incorrect. I want to be paying the correct amount. The XXXX operators have been unable to advise me on what amount I should be paying. I have asked if I should pay what I think I owe, and the operators have given me mixed opinions only. There does n't seem to be a policy to address this issue. Currently, they request that I make a payment of under {$6.00} per month. I make around XXXX annually, and the payoff amount on my XXXX account is over XXXX. I am not an accountant, but this seems very obviously incorrect. 
When I look at my individual loans in my XXXX account, my loans show that my last payment was in XX/XX/XXXX, but I have paid the total due, on time, each and every month. 
I have tried calling XXXX three times in the past 4 days. I am not able to get through to an operator anymore. I get a recording that asks me to call back later. I have emailed XXXX last week recapping this problem. I have not received an acknowledgment that anyone has received my e-mail. In the past two months, I have spent more than two hours per week on average trying to understand what I can do to fix these problems.

1/21/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"I found out earlier today that my loan servicer, Navient, was not honest with me. The company is not fair in the way they conduct business and never disclosed any details about my loans nor offered any type of documentation or reminder that interest on my student loans would accumulate daily. I had suspicions about this company from the get-go, however, today I found out they were being sued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. While I already contacted the CFPB and a representative was kind enough to share details about the lawsuit, it was a lot of information to take in. XX/XX/XXXX, I called Navient to obtain information about repayment options. It was then that I found out that approximately {$6300.00} in interest had accumulated on XXXX particular loan ( XXXX Direct Parent PLUS ). I originally requested the student loans XX/XX/XXXX. Obviously I was shocked and disgusted by this that I thought to myself, "" How can this happen, why was n't I notified and who is responsible for this? '' Obviously I complained to Navient, however, they only made excuses and blamed the U.S. Department of Education and blamed me for not reading the fine print. I called the XXXX Department of Education to find some answers and they were worse and came up with more excuses and at times blamed the government and Navient. Navient was very quick to tell me that they can place me in deferment or forbearance until i was ready to pay. However, after finding out that interest accumulates daily I said, "" absolutely not ''. On XX/XX/XXXX, I started making payments to Navient for some of the student loans. On XX/XX/XXXX, I paid a huge chunk of the loan which totaled {$25000.00}. If it had not been for the outrageous interest fees, my balance would be much less, in fact the original principal amount was {$19000.00}. That is a difference of {$6300.00}. Outrageous! Keep in mind, I paid with money I saved over the last 15 years. In my opinion, this is fraud at its worst. I also believe that this is the reason Navient is being sued, however, I am not clear about this whole lawsuit thing. I am asking that my complaint be taken seriously and not fall on deaf ears. I am requesting a refund for the interest that has accumulated since XXXX on my paid student loan. I also believe something needs to change in the way loan servicers such as Navient conduct business with consumers. To be honest, I never knew that interest would accumulate daily on my student loans. Please keep in mind, when I paid for my biggest loan ( {$25000.00} ) on XX/XX/XXXX, the new loan balance for the remaining loan numbers ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX ) was now {$28000.00}, give or take. Since making my monthly payments beginning XX/XX/XXXX for the remaining loans, to this date the loan balance has only been reduced to approximately {$27000.00}. I am making a sacrifice to pay back these loans and at this rate, it will be impossible to pay off the loans during my lifetime, if Navient is allowed to continue doing business in this manner. I struggle each month to pay for these loans along with having to pay back medical bills, hospital bills, utility bills, other loans, etc. Also, XX/XX/XXXX, I found out that Navient had placed my loans on deferment without my singed permission. Obviously interest accrued for this time frame and it is very upsetting that they did this without my authorization. On the document I submitted where it shows my account history, please make note of pages XXXX & XXXX where it is dated XX/XX/XXXX for Direct Parent Plus Loan XXXX. Here you can clearly see the interest in the amount of {$910.00} and {$5400.00} for a grand total of {$6300.00}. I also included a document which shows my current loan balance on the remainder of my loans. Take a look at the interest that has already accrued. Please, I am turning to you for help on this matter.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",TX,799XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,1/21/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,2302464
1/29/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Denied loan,"During the XXXX school year, I was enrolled in the school counseling licensure program. The curriculum included a year-long internship at two separate school sites, totaling about 30 hours/week. These work-hours did not include separate coursework/final projects/licensing. So while the amount of credit-hours for this coursework was considered "" part-time '' the actual time investment was more than full-time ( 40 hours/week ). 

Here 's the catch, and this is importantthese internships we UNPAID. As a student with an Expected Family Contribution of XXXX dollars, I obviously had to apply for a private student loan to pay for tuition and cost of living. 

I was approved for a private loan of {$20000.00}, which I split into thirds for disbursement at Fall/Winter/Spring terms. 

After the Spring term disbursement, I had discovered a mistake in the number of credit hours I had been billed for during the Fall/Winter terms. XXXX did not create the proper course numbers for students in the licensure-only program, and so I was signed up for the same course that the Masters students had to take, which included a different number of credit-hours than I actually needed. 

This mistake meant that I had been signed up for 5 or more credit-hours for Fall/Winter terms. What I did not know, and nobody told me about, was that if a student takes less than 5 credit-hours, they aren't able to receive financial aid in the form of student loans. So when Spring term came around, I signed up for the classes I needed, and received my 3rd and final loan disbursement. At this point, I had a closer look at my completed coursework, and discovered that I had completed too many credits than what the licensure program entailed. This is when I discovered that the school had made a mistake, and did not create the proper course number for licensure-only students. Not needing to pay for extra credits to qualify for licensure, my professor made an adjustment to the number of credits I had enrolled in. 

This put me below the 5-credit threshold for financial aid. As a result, the school added a "" negative credit '' to my account, which apparently is another way of saying I had to return the 3rd and final disbursement of my PRIVATE STUDENT LOAN. Apparently they would have taken the money and returned it to my lender. So, I contacted my lenderthey didn't want me to return the money. They wanted me to complete my licensure. 

I understand the rational hereif you are only taking a few credits, you are expected to be working, making money, and paying for those credits out-of-pocket. Sounds good. But in my situation, I was completing a full-time internship. And the course for this internship only involved 2 CREDIT HOURS. 

Essentially, the financial aid system is saying that in addition to the full-time internshipnot to mention the absurd amount of work required for completing the state-licensure requirement on top of all thatI should be working full-time to pay for both tuition and cost-of-living. 

Obviously that scenario is impossible, so I was left with 2 options : drop the whole program and go back to work, or take out an additional loan. So obviously I would have to take out another loan, because I need to pay for my cost-of-living while completing an unpaid internship. But this is where it all gets crazy-making. So I would have applied for an additional ~ {$3000.00} to pay for the "" negative balance '' on my XXXX billing account. But I didn't borrow money from XXXX, so they would have returned it to my loan lender, after borrowing it from the lender.

I opted for a total of a {$25000.00}, which was inclusive of a private loan serviced by the University I attended. In short, I paid "" in full '' my private loan through the University totalling approximately {$2500.00} However, to date, Navient has me owing a total of {$27000.00}. Any civil person would ask, "" how is that even remotely possible?! '' When XXXX sold my loan to Navient, I had a balance of approximately {$19000.00} - and that 's being generous. According to the records XXXX posted about 8 months prior to the buyout, my original amount was around {$17000.00} ( maybe a tad bit more ). Fast forward to the initial day Navient wrote me about their respective turnover. Navient reported an amount upwards of {$27000.00}!! I contacted many departments from XXXX and Navient and to no avail found anybody who could provide me with my original loan information. Just POOF - gone! Finally, I was able to track down a representative from Navient who informed me that any documentation prior to the buyout was not available. Furthermore, the representative mentioned that even if I had diligent record keeping from XXXX, Navient was sold the loan for {$27000.00}. {$27000.00} was the final amount - end of story. 

I relayed to them that that was impossible, and that the total amount given was NOT even the original amount borrowed. The representative ( s ) never sympathized nor exhibited a need to even try and make a wrong a right. I continued down the journey of paying the "" crooked '' Navient system ( if you ask "" why '', I further explain towards the end of this complaint ). 

As time went on, my account amount never decreased. As time went on, they kept on making new rules and explanations/ '' excuses '' as to why my account amount did not decrease. Not only did in not decrease, THE AMOUNT INCREASED! 

Fast forward to my graduation. Instead of providing me with an opportunity to secure a job with the alotted, promised "" deferment '' time frame ( I believe ~ 6 months ), the first thing they did was raise my payment due. I graduated in XXXX and received a notice at the end of the month regarding my new amount due, which was {$640.00}. {$640.00}!! This must be a joke, right?! 

Needless to say, I still remain with the company in hopes I receive justice from the Navient system. I was advised by many to remain with Navient and fight for what is fair. I was also advised that if I left Navient that my queries as to what I rightfully owe will be null and void. 

Please help! Your agency was brought to my attention by alternate financial aid advisors. To add insult to injury, I just checked my Navient account today. My total amount has increased, yet again. And to make matters worse, XXXX loans that are suppose to remain at a "" fixed APR '' have increased. Now if that does n't warrant assistance, I do n't know what does. Please facilitate my claim!

9/20/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"I called into my loan service center ( XXXX XXXX XXXX ) about XXXX/XXXX/XXXX or XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to report hardship due to my being recently laid off unemployed for the 2nd time in 10 months and to request for forbearance. I also informed XXXX XXXX that it is a great struggle even when I am working to be able to make the {$800.00} payment and support my family. 
I was told by a XXXX XXXX representative that the private student loan that I have only comes with 12 months of forbearance for the life of the loan ( Current balance {$66000.00} ) and there are no other options for lowering my payments or forbearance. I was told by the same representative that XXXX XXXX is only the 3rd party loan servicer and has no authority over making any decisions on my loan. I was told I would have to contact the loan originator to see if they are willing to help me. I asked who was my loan originator and I was told by XXXX XXXX that they have in their system that my loan originator was EastWest Bank. 
I contacted East West Banks Loan Department around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( almost a week before my loan payment was due ) and spoke with XXXX, employee # XXXX in the loan department. I explained my concerns, issues and requests to XXXX. XXXX informed me that there was something that could possibly be done to help me in my situation, but I had to call the loan servicer, XXXX XXXX, back and ask for someone on their escalation team. XXXX informed me that once I get to speak with someone on the escalation team, I need to explain my situation to them and they will need contact East West Bank to do a "" loan work-out ''. XXXX informed me that the communication to get me the help I needed had to be done between the two companies. 
So, I called XXXX XXXX back the same day ( I believe ) and spoke to XXXX, the supervisor on the XXXX XXXX escalation team. I explained to XXXX the whole situation that lead up to my call to XXXX at East West Bank and what XXXX XXXX instructions were to get me help. XXXX relayed that he has been the supervisor in his position for quite some time now and has never heard of a situation that requires the two banks to communicate with each other for a 'loan work-out '. XXXX, eager to get me help and clearly as confused as I was, stayed on the line as I contacted XXXX, in East West Banks Loan Department, again for clarification. 
I did not reach XXXX, but a lady in the same department instead. I relayed to her the nature of the call and asked for XXXX. She insisted that I give her a chance to help. I told her what XXXX recommended I do and that the supervisor of the escalation team at XXXX XXXX was not sure what they were asking. The lady confirmed what XXXX was telling me to do and encouraged me to call XXXX XXXX again and ask for XXXX XXXX ' contact for East West Bank. 
At that time, XXXX spoke up and introduced himself to the lady representative and relayed that he has never done what she is suggesting nor was he aware of any contact that XXXX XXXX has for communicating with East West Bank. XXXX asked the lady at East West Bank who the contact is that works at XXXX XXXX that they are referring to. The lady said the contact 's name is XXXX XXXX. After XXXX and I ended the call with the lady at East West Bank, he informed me that he 's still not sure what East West Bank is talking about, but would do some research to see if they have an employee by that name, then give me a call back. 
XXXX contacted me a day later, I believe, and relayed that they do have an employee by the name of XXXX XXXX, but she is only an Analyst for the company and does not have any affiliation with East West Bank as their contact or anything else. XXXX relayed that XXXX said that she used to communicate with them years ago, but that was a very long time ago. 
At this point, I had become very exhausted and frustrated. My student loan payment of {$800.00} is due. I borrowed money from family and paid the loan in order not to default. 
I contacted East West Bank again, around XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to reiterate that what they recommended previously was unheard of and I needed help with my situation immediately. That day, I spoke again with XXXX, employee # XXXX. XXXX gave no explanation of why they sent me on a wild goose chase to do something that was n't even possible/an option. He told me that he understood my frustration and that at this point, I need to write a letter to the East West Bank loan department explaining what recently happened and what I needed. 
I wrote the letter on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, addressed it to the Loan Department and emailed it to the email address provided ( XXXXXXXXXXXX ) and included my name, loan #, and the problem exactly how I was instructed to do so by XXXX. 
Having not heard anything from either East West Bank or XXXX XXXX, I contacted East West Bank on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX to inquire about the status of my request. I spoke again with XXXX that day. He looked into the system and relayed that he found the emailed letter that I had sent. He relayed that the outcome was that East West Bank is no longer the holder of my loan and that it had been transferred/sold to a different company. I asked why they did n't notice this a while back. XXXX relayed that he discovered that the day I called in and he recommended that I write a letter. 
XXXX informed me to call XXXX XXXX, my loan servicer to get the name of the company that now handles my loan. I asked XXXX why could n't they give me the name of the new loan holder, do n't I have consumer writes that requires the company who sold my loan to give me the name of the lender they sold it to? XXXX noted that I sure do have writes and XXXX XXXX should have this information for me, but East West Bank does not have access to that information. 
I contacted XXXX, from XXXX XXXX the same day and relayed what I had just learned and asked if he could give me the name of the lender that hold my loan now. I relayed how frustrated I was at this point and asked why was I sent over to East West Bank in the first place if they no longer own my loan? XXXX relayed that he would look into getting me the name of the lender and contact information, but the person he needed to speak to was out of town until the next day, so he would have to call me back then. 
XXXX did call me back the next day and provided XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX as the name of the new holder of my loan and the contact number ( XXXX ). 
I tried contacting XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX at the number provided on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( I got a fax machine sound only ), then again on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX ( recording saying the number I 've reached is not in service ).",Company has responded to the consumer and the CFPB and chooses not to provide a public response,EAST WEST BANK,CO,802XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/20/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2679427

5/25/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Problem lowering your monthly payments,"To Whom this May Concern- I had my federal student loans previously with XXXX and I consolidated with Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX with payment of {$380.00} I was paying my student loan on time and was current with Nelnet up until XX/XX/XXXX. My family had some financial hardship and I had to make a decision to place my student loan on a forbearance until XX/XX/XXXX. 

I then saw on XXXX some news, regarding school loan servicers, Nelnet and XXXX, in hot water with multiple complaints with consumers. On the article they had a number for a third party that stated it could help lower your payments. 

I called and it sounded like a great idea. I only had to make 5 monthly payments of {$230.00} and then my new payment would be an estimated {$90.00} for 20 years and then the rest of my loan would be forgiven. I did sign the contract and then cancelled immediately because I felt as if it was too good to be true. 

I called to verify my cancellation and also spoke with a manager that confirmed I was on approved for the Pay as You Earn plan. Basically pay the 5 monthly payments of {$230.00} and then 20 years of $ 90 monthly payments and then the rest of my loan was forgiven. She assured me that this program was offered on StudentLoans.gov. 

Below is the verbiage from the third party welcome letter. 

XXXX, It was a pleasure speaking with you, and thank you very much for taking the time to speak with me regarding your Student loan options. 
We provide assistance to borrowers with federal student loans by helping you navigate the myriad of available programs designed to provide financial assistance. We will guide you through the steps necessary to apply and qualify for your benefits with the U.S. Department of Education. We are dedicated to helping people take advantage of U.S. Department of Education approved Direct Consolidation Loan programs. With these programs some of the benefits include : one lender, one payment, fixed rate, a lower payment and/or possible loan forgiveness. I would be happy to assist you in our prescreening process to determine your eligibility for loan forgiveness & consolidation programs.

For general information, you may view our website at XXXX XXXX XXXX/ For specifics please call me on my direct number ( XXXX ) XXXXXXXX. There is no cost or obligation to determine whether any of these U.S. Department of Education sponsored programs can benefit you. 

Listed below are many helpful links about receiving student loan benefits : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX : REVIEWS & COMPLAINTS XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX NELNET XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX | Senior Loan Advisor XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Office : XXXX | Fax : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX The information contained in this electronic transmission, and any attachments, may contain CONFIDENTIAL information. The information is intended only for use by the addressee named above. Any unauthorized use, disclosure, dissemination or copying of the contents of the information and any attachments contained in this electronic transmission is strictly prohibited. If you are not the intended addressee, please notify the sender immediately and delete this message. 

I did reach out to the customer service of the Department of Education and they did take down my complaint regarding the third party agreement that was offered. I was told I could just apply on studentloans.gov in order to try to get a lower payment. 

I did go on and apply on studentloans.gov around the end of last month, XXXX. 

I reached out to Nelnet via messenger today and asked for an update regarding my application. This was her response : "" The plan has been processed and your monthly payment is {$500.00} and is effective XX/XX/XXXX. '' "" You are on the revised Pay As you Earn Repayment Plan. Signing the application and submitting it is requesting to have the payment recalculated ''. You're interest rate is 6.25 % ''. 

My previous interest rate was 6.13 %. 

According to my account information on Nelnet 's website, my payment for the first year will be {$500.00} and then for the rest of the term it will be {$700.00}. 

The customer service rep did not mention this jump in payment. 

This is not lower than my current payment. I understand that interest accrues till when you put your loan in a forbearance. So, I thought that was why, but I asked her and her response was the following : "" No, as only {$110.00} of interest was from the forbearance. '' "" The payment plan is based on the income and family size. '' I am beyond frustrated at this point. Why would I want to agree to a higher payment if I was trying to get a lower payment?? It makes no sense that I was not able to agree or decline to the higher payment. 

I would think if a person were applying to an income based repayment plan for the goal of lowering my payment, how increasing my rate and payment makes any sense. 

I told the lady from Nelnet that I would be contacting the CFPB and she immediately said she could try to qualify me for 2 other options. 

One option was to lower my payment to {$430.00} and extend my term to 25 years. It is called the E

xtended Standard Repayment Plan.

The second option was called the Extended Graduated Repayment Plan, the payment starts out at {$330.00}, then {$350.00}, then {$370.00}. the payment increases 15 % every two years for 25 years. At the end of the term my payment would be {$640.00}. 

I wanted to file a complaint because I think this process is very unfair and almost abusive to the consumer. 

Not allowing me to review the new terms and agree or disagree is not okay. 

I feel that including a spouse 's income because we filed jointly and then he or she is not responsible for the loan at any point, makes absolutely no sense. 

If my husband left the picture, I would have to pay this loan myself. Obviously, it would be life change so then I would have to re-apply would probably get a lower payment. 

If something happens to me, such as death, the loan goes away. He isn't held responsible so his income should not be used, in my opinion. 

I also don't appreciate that I can't get a lower payment to what fits my income but people who don't make any money and live off the government ( which also comes out of my checks every month ) can go to school for free. 

I should have had XXXX kids right out of high school and been a single mom so I could have went to school for free. 

This whole process is backwards. I worked very hard for my degree and I will basically be struggling though life financially because I am not qualified for a lower payment to fit my needs. I have XXXX kids and work a full time job. I have a mortgage, car payments, utilities, diaper and formula bills ( no state assistance ), grocery bills, etc. I am not asking for a free ride, I'm asking for some assistance. 

I am asking that someone really re-evaluates the approval process or create a program for individuals who need a plan for that fits their specific needs. My husband does not have any school loans. He was in the military for 8 years. 

Below is my exactly how much I am actually paying towards this loan and all the interest Nelnet is collecting.

More than half a million people may have found themselves in that situation after a new legal filing by the Education Department. 

Under a program known as Public Service Loan Forgiveness, some student loan borrowers were supposed to be able to have the balance of their student loans forgiven after ten years of both on-time payments and eligible work in the public sector. Meaning, a qualifying nonprofit, federal, local, state, or tribal government. 

The program started in 2007, so the first debt was set to be forgiven this coming fall. 

Last year a small group of borrowers learned that their eligibility for the program had revoked. These include four people, all attorneys, working for the XXXX, the XXXX, and XXXX. 


Student Loan Debt Has Nearly Tripled In The Last Decade NPR Ed A New Look At The Lasting Consequences Of Student Debt Nonprofits like these are not 501 ( c ) 3 charities or foundations, so it may be ambiguous whether they fall under the law 's definition of "" public service ''. But the four argued in a lawsuit last XXXX, joined by the bar association itself, that their status should n't have been revoked, certainly not retroactively. 

They had followed all the necessary steps to qualify for forgiveness. They 'd enrolled in the correct repayment program and filled out an Employment Certification Form with XXXX, which acts on behalf of the Education Department. That form certifies that borrowers work for a qualifying organization or a federal, state, tribal or city agency. It 's suggested borrowers file an ECF every year. 





On XXXX, the department responded to the suit, saying, "" XXXX XXXX 's response to the ECF does not reflect a final agency action on the borrower 's qualifications for PSLF. '' Meaning, in essence, all those years that borrowers submitted certification forms, the department was n't making any promises about forgiveness. 

Technically, the department is only responding to the narrow question about whether this small category of organizations is considered public service or not. However, "" The retroactive aspect of this filing reasonably causes people to be nervous, '' says XXXX, a senior fellow at the XXXX and a former Deputy Undersecretary of Education under Obama, where he was responsible for overseeing the program during its early years. 

Nervous is right. More than half a million borrowers have signed up for the program. So we put the word out to find out how they were feeling. We heard "" frightened, '' "" anxious, '' "" uncertainty, '' "" regret, '' "" betrayed. '' XXXX, who works for a nonprofit providing legal services to the elderly in XXXX, Idaho, has about {$80000.00} in debt. Like many borrowers, she told us, "" A lot of my life-planning decisions were made factoring the loan forgiveness into the equation. '' She says she turned down higher-paying jobs in the private sector, for example. "" I would feel very betrayed, for both myself and my XXXX sons, if this program is taken away, '' she says. "" I would likely end up paying on my loans until I was in my XXXX and would have no ability to save for retirement or to help pay for my children 's college. '' XXXX is a parole officer in Texas with about {$30000.00} in loans.

Consolidation. Make sure your student loans are right for you if you are having trouble making your monthly payment then consolidation may be the right option for you. Federal loan allows you to combine one or more existing student loans into a single new loan.

A North Carolina Lawyer, a North Carolina Congressman, and American Education Services own statement clearly points out that the Promissory Note XXXX XXXX entered into must have the same payment throughout the loan.

From a legal viewpoint XXXX XXXX through its representative XXXX XXXX XXXX is not only refusing to abide by North Carolina lending laws, XXXX XXXX is now falsely or unknowingly presenting XXXX XXXX XXXX as a Federal Student loan agency though its administrator AES. 

One of the things NC XXXX District Congressman XXXX XXXX office explained to me was unless a Federal Law has been broken there is nothing we can do to help. I am told that from a legal standpoint that XXXX XXXX letter dated XX/XX/XXXX implies that XXXX  XXXX a private loan institution is going far beyond legal lending practices by stating that through AES they have the same legal jurisdiction as the federal Government. Unless XXXX  XXXX and AES can come up with concrete documentation issued by the Federal Government stating that they have Federal Student Loan lending rights then it seems oblivious XXXX XXXX and AES are braking federal law. The federal law listed below has been violated and it opens up the door for a Congressional investigation. 

Whoever falsely assumes or pretends to be an officer or employee acting under the authority of the United States or any department, agency or officer thereof, and acts as such, or in such pretended character demands or obtains any money, paper, document, or thing of value, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than three years, or both.

And as previously stated, my position remains the same in that I am not responsible for this debt and will not agree to pay any portion. If payment is what you request, please take the appropriate legal action and file the necessary paperwork with the appropriate court system for further consideration. Otherwise your wasting your time. Also, you addressed only one of my requests. Please refer to the complaint I filed onXX/XX/XXXX with the CFPB and fulfil each of the listed requests. You are obligated by federal law to provide truthful, accurate, and pertinent information regarding any debt that you service. In rebuttal to your formal response dated XX/XX/XXXX : Number 1 : Unfortunately for you, I have to deny and challenge the authenticity of this forbearance I allegedly signed for a few reasons. One : I did not sign or submit a request for forbearance at any time. The production of such document further proves that AES engages in forgery and falsifying documents. It is all too easy for anyone to replicate or reproduce a digital copy of a signature ; any document editing program can accomplish this with little effort or knowledge. See Attachment 1 for an example of a forged document that was effortlessly created in an ordinary word processing program by simply copying and pasting. Two : Is it common for a borrower to request a forbearance for less than 2 months, or for only 2 days as indicated on these charts? Why would I, knowing that I would never be able to nor agree to pay any portion of this debt sign a document asking for a couple days to a couple months of a grace period? It is illogical to think I or anyone would do this. If I had requested the max amount of time allowed for a forbearance, that would make more sense. Three : The Deferment/Forbearance charts show the dates of when these forbearances/deferments were applied. Yet, the dates do not correspond with the fake document you provided. On the forbearance document the dates are XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXX. The chart shows dates of XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX. And within your letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, you state that I requested the forbearance fromXX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXX. So obviously there are too many discrepancies, lies, and illicit activities for you to keep track of. Four : You provided only one document, though extremely sketchy, indicating that I requested one ( 1 ) forbearance. Are there any other documents your willing to produce that indicate I requested the other eight ( 8 ) deferments/forbearances? I encourage you to send more documents like this to add as evidence that will aid in convicting you of fraud.
<P/>
I will for one moment, just for the XXXX of it, entertain the idea that I requested a forbearance for an unusual short period of time. Lets keep in mind the dates in this scenario and realize that it was only 3 months after I was forced to withdraw from school that the forbearance was supposedly processed. And this request is only effective for a couple of days to a couple of months, depending on which piece of alleged evidence you base it on. Lets also keep in mind that I was still the same young and nave boy that was duped into signing a ridiculous predatory contract, maybe about 1.5 years older than at the time of signing. It wasnt until years later that I discovered how much full of XXXX this contract and AES are, which was around the same time I began seriously disputing the debt. Now, ignorance isnt normally a worthy defense. But if its a situation where a loan shark is targeting and taking advantage of a certain demographic that has zero understanding of debt or has no suspicion that theyre about to be attacked ; then yes, ignorance is their only defense, or more simply the victim ( me ) was defenseless. And the shark knows full well their own intentions. We can see proof in Attachment 2 that at the time of the signing, I lacked the capacity to engage in such a contract. I was uninformed of how student loans worked and had no understanding of the contents of the MPN. Not to place blame on anyone for my lack of capacity, but blame is placed on you for taking advantage. Also, in Section L, item 3 of the MPN reads, I understand that I must repay this Note though I may be less than 18 years of age when the application is signed.
<P/>
So, had I been 13 years old when I signed this contract, would I still be obligated to pay? Would you attempt to permanently ruin a 13 year olds life and rid their chances for success, all for money? I think this brings about a serious legal, moral, and ethical problem which sheds light on the true predatory intentions of AES, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX.
<P/>
Number 2 : Referencing Section C item 6 of the MPN- Interim Period states, If I have chosen to defer repayment while in school Take notice to how the statement clearly identifies who initiates a deferment. Nowhere in MPN does is give any right to the servicer or holder of the loan to initiate such changes. I never chose to defer, I simply chose to refuse repayment.
<P/>
Im also confused on what my enrollment status has to do with me not agreeing to pay you. It seems like a nice gesture to apply these changes- in school deferments, military deferments, etc. It gives the false impression that you care about my financial wellbeing. But, I did not request these changes nor do I care if you know what my enrollment status is. You capitalized on this information after I began seriously disputing the debt. At which time you applied these alterations without my consent. From the time I left XXXX College in XXXX XXXX until XXXX XXXX, the loan was delinquent/in default. The only changes I authorized or requested was the removal of negative credit reporting, loan forgiveness/discharge, and complete removal of all tradelines from my credit report.
<P/>
Number 3 -5 : Im going to ignore these, they are irrelevant to the issue at hand. Except for the fact that you have yet to provide basic information on what an Administrative Forbearance is and how its applied. Something I requested in my previous letter.
<P/>
Number 6 : This is just blatantly false in every way. Im not even sure what you mean that you received notification that I withdrew from XXXX XXXX College on XX/XX/XXXX. Id like to see that notification, because I know what my dates of attendance were. I have transcripts to prove it.
Finally, AES speaks some truth. I agree that you transferred the account to XXXX XXXX XXXX on or aroundXX/XX/XXXX.
<P/>
However, as far as this email is concerned that you claim I sent you, though it seems to be similar to the hundreds of emails that Ive sent, Im having a hard time confirming its authenticity. I have records of all email traffic and this specific email is not registering. Please provide verification that this email exists. As it stands now, it looks as though you simply typed it out is your response letter. I can easily say that I received an email from XXXX XXXX that says, XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am truly sorry for the hardship that AES and I have caused you. We all agree that you are no longer responsible for this debt and we will immediately remove this from your credit history. Again, reference Attachment 1 as an example of how false evidence can easily be created. I also have evidence that shows you have purposely omitted and altered certain parts of email conversations in order to misrepresent the truth. See Attachment 3. Provide a copy of the email which must include all email addresses involved, dates, times, contents, replies, and a confirmation email addressed to me indicating the email was received-AES regularly sends automatic reply emails confirming receipt of any email sent to their addresses.
Additionally, if this email exists, it still does not represent a formal request for a deferment/forbearance. There are multiple deferment/forbearance forms on your website, similar to the one you claim that I signed and submitted. Even if it did represent a formal request, it was made after the fact that you charged off the debt and closed the account in XXXX XXXX, as indicated in one of your previous responses. See Attachment 5. Unless this email was a fabrication as well.
<P/>
Number 7 & 8 : Again, enlighten me how and why XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX was authorized to reverse the default status. Is this right stated in the MPN? After explicitly stating that I refuse to pay, why would FCDB authorize such changes? And please explain why every AES customer service representative and PHEAA consumer advocate I spoke to stated there is no record of any default or delinquency. Are you concealing or erasing critical information pertinent to this issue? Or are they all instructed to lie to me?
<P/>
Number 9 : Another piece of evidence I can agree with, the fact that I disputed the default status yet again on or around XX/XX/XXXX. This is a very import time frame as it was the time in which you authorized my request of tradeline removal from my credit report due to fraudulent activity. You have repeatedly lied and placed blame on the credit bureaus for this removal. This caused a deliberate delay and misdirection from seeking the truth- an unfair and deceptive business practice which is punishable by Pennsylvania state law.
<P/>
Though I do not recall requesting that ALL SCRA benefits be applied, I do have verification of me requesting that the insanely high interest rate of over 15 % be reduced to the SCRA maximum of 6.0 % as well as noting that you refused to acknowledge an in-school deferment for the years of XXXX. See Attachment 4. However, even if this in school deferment that I inquired about, not formally requested, was applied, and according to your deferment chart, would actually be meaningless since the debt was charged off and closed in XXXX XXXX as you previously stated.
Regarding Section H of the MPN, it reads, If I am unable to repay my loan in accordance with the terms established under this Note, I may request that you modify these terms. I understand that such modification would be at your option This section clearly states once again that the borrower ( me ) initiates the request for term modification. Nowhere does the MPN give exclusive rights to the owner, servicer, lender, etc. of modifying the terms of the agreement without the consent of the borrower, much less without written confirmation that the terms were in fact modified and the details of the modification.
<P/>
It is a misinterpretation and very misleading to say that a forbearance period, may be granted at the holders discretion based on your inability to repay the loans You are misconstruing, manipulating, and omitting details of the actual meaning and wording of the agreement to justify your argument. No competent judge or investigator would agree to your interpretation and they would immediately dismiss your argument. Much like your interpretation of federal regulations not applying to this issue. See Attachment 5.
<P/>
Other Considerations : Regardless of all of this, the fact is these changes were made without my consent well after you charged off and closed the account in XXXX XXXX. See Attachment 6. Your response holds no significance other than the fact that you were attempting to clean up your mess and conceal your mistakes after I identified your illicit activities. It also shows how evasive you are in answering my questions, which is typical of a deceptive person. How did AES restore this debt after it was charged off and closed? What are the actual dates in which you applied any changes to the account? Careful in answering these questions so as not to dig even a deeper hole. It is illegal to alter accounting records, conceal information, and intentionally misrepresent account statuses, all of which are punishable under federal and state laws. You explicitly told me over the phone and in several letters that you reversed the default status in order to prevent a charge off, even though it was already charged off and closed. What was your intention in doing that? Also, Im curious, is this MPN subject to state usury laws? If so, which state ( s ) apply? If were basing it on California usury laws, which is where the contract was signed, the original interest rates of 15.357 % and 15.742 % as indicated in the disclosure statements, is well above the cap of 10 %, which voids the contract. See Attachment 7.
<P/>
Below youll find my previous requests, the ones that you continue to avoid answering, along with new questions that need answering. Answer all in full detail and DO NOT evade in responding to any of the questions/requests. Respond directly, accurately, and truthfully. Failure to accurately and truthfully respond to my requests/questions is a violation of federal law and the appropriate authorities will be notified. You are obligated to deliver truthful information and a full disclosure regarding any debt you claim I owe.

3/3/17,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"In XX/XX/XXXX, I attended a school called XXXX XXXX XXXX School of Idaho. I was XXXX years old. When I looked into enrolling they told me the school was about to be picked up federally for loan services. The school took my name, all my information and in two weeks said "" sign this loan to attend '' no one reviewed or explained that even with my father as a cosigner our credit rating they gave us combined was poor. At the time he was over XXXX and I was over XXXX. Cosigned through XXXX XXXX was a XXXX or something like that. At XXXX who knows that, plus I was a state away from my parents who could not come into the office of the school to review the loan either. Basically finished course, could not get work because I was too young and no one recognized my school. Few years later learned the school did get picked up by a federal collage and they some how "" lost my records ''. I have been paying on a loan that basically got me no work or possible work in the future. At the time XXXX XXXX told me tough luck and basically unless I had an attorney they would not assist me further because all the cared about was me paying my monthly bill, which was over 13 %. Once the full amount of loan was going, I could not afford it due to no job from my school training. Thought I did a deferment, ended up Forbarance. Few years later I still could not get an attorney to help me, I drove back to Idaho where the school was and confronted the president. He refused to help me short of basically re enrolling me through the program. Stated they some how lost three years of records from the last teaching staff when they left. 

I then was too busy with my XXXX and soon deploying to even have a chance to keep chasing attorneys. Navient had taken over my loan before XXXX, I had to spend three months and sending them my XXXX paperwork to get the 6 % loan rate while over seas. They kept telling me "" it 's a private loan, you d not qualify foe any assistance '', in the end 6 % APR. While over seas my {$300.00} plus monthly payment would still only have {$95.00} dollars going to the actual loan on some monthly payments. When I called Navient they told me I have a variable APR, so the loan is at 6 % but yet we they hit me for a $ XXXX- {$310.00} in interest in one month, when the monthly payment was $ XXXX- {$350.00}. 

When I got back in XX/XX/XXXX, the school has mysteriously been closed. I called Navient and explained the whole situation and how due to statutes of limitation I was running out of time to get an attorney to help me with the school. All I was asking at the time was to have the paperwork sent to me to remove my Cosigner since I have not missed a single payment or late in the last 5 years. They were more then glad to assist, but yet no paperwork. When I called them they reassured me they were going to send the papers and do everything they can to help me. Months go by, nothing. Called again and the advisor on the phone got very rude, kept interrupting me, telling me I was the one who signed this loan and it was my problem. I asked if the call was being recorded for records and they did n't want to answer the question. In end, basically asked them do I need an attorney to just get me cosigner released, they interrupted me again and said the same thing every time I have ever called, "" it is a private loan, you do not qualify for any help, assistance, or legal help ''. 

At this point I am in a different career of work, wanting to buy a home ect, but I can not get away from this company changing my APR monthly and payments are going up every couple of months now. I still have not received the Cosigner release, and last few conversations with them ended with no help, and they will not even let me speak to there fraud department.

3/27/17,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"In dealing with XXXX, and now Navient in regards to my private student loan, I have been charged an exorbitant amount of fees and late charges due to the mishandling of my account. While trying to resolve any matter or request assistance from a representative, I was always quickly rushed off the phone. Its like they are not allowed to speak with a customer for more than 5 minutes. The representatives at Navient were always quick to push me into a forbearance but never offered any other type of program that may make it easier to afford my loan. Even while on XXXX with the XXXX, the only program offered to me was forbearance. Whats worse, is that on my last XXXX, my forbearance that I thought was for the duration of my orders, was only for one month. After I returned from XXXX I found my account severely past due and I owed months of late fees. You would think that when you are 60, 90 days past due they would make an attempt to call you and resolve the payment issue like most creditors do. Not Navient, they seem perfectly happy with you as long as they have their late fees on top of the interest which never stops. 
Another issue is that they offer no assistance if your on a private student loan and have a XXXX student loan repayment contract. The XXXX is kind enough to make one large payment a year to my loan, unfortunately, Navient does not allow this one payment to be the sole payment for the year, even though it is 3x larger than the sum of my regularly scheduled monthly payments.

Multiple accounts still show even though a consolidation was completed ( subsidized and un-subsidized ) and payments or additional payments can not be directed to pay off either the other loans or directly to principle. Multiple accounts means multiple credit account history. If there are XXXX showing on the account summary, I expect XXXX to be reported on. In this case, they state XXXX account and multiple are reported. This is inaccurate reporting. On this matter, I discussed this with Navient that it was showing multiple accounts and that the consolidation should then close out the paid off loans.

Loan Forgiveness is only for federal loans not private. I voice my disapproval and concern about being lied to but got no where. I finally agreed to set up payments through this rate reduction plan and was told that it was only for 6 months but the plan required 12 months of payments. I was also told that this is a step program and that the payments were definitely going to increase. The payment was to be automatic from my checking account in the amount of {$160.00} for 6 months and then the remaining six payments would be {$340.00} per month. I expressed that I could n't afford that and would not agree to a pre-recording a message that stated that. I was unable to workout a suitable or affordable payment plan with them. I am continuing to call in hopes of finding an understanding rep. 
Also, I have read that there is a lawsuit involving Navient and CFPB. I am interesting in being apart of the lawsuit.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",FL,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/22/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2762448

The original issue is not resolved, and it does n't make sense for CFPB to close out the case if they receive a letter from a Fed Loan Servicing Vice President. 
Fed Loan Servicing recently sent me an updated service history showing XXXX payments qualifying towards the PSLF program, better than the XXXX they had on file before I asked for an audit, and better than the XXXX they dropped me down to once the audit started. XXXX "" qualifying '' payments are needed to forgive my loans, meaning I have to send in the amount due in total each month. XXXX payments were marked as non-qualifying as "" full installment was not satisfied ''. Fed Loan Servicing intentionally shorted the amount due ( in bold print ) so I wo n't be able to reach the XXXX qualifying payments. Please review the attached documents proving the Fed Loan Servicing sent me XXXX incorrect monthly "" payment amount due '' invoices. All XXXX payments are off by a total of {$3.00}, and I would be willing to pay the {$3.00} to get these XXXX payments into compliance. 
There is more to the story, so please read the attached word document and see scanned in images of the invoices in question. XXXX payment made to XXXX, the servicer prior to Fed Loan Servicing was XXXX PENNY short back in XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I am requesting that Fed Loan Servicing produce the invoice so we can see if that contained an incorrect amount due total. 
Fed Loan Servicing Borrower Advocate XXXX XXXX was assigned to work with me. I am corresponding with Senator XXXX XXXX 's office. I have made a complaint to the XXXX Ombudsman 's office and submitted a complaint at XXXX feedback center. 
Something is not right at XXXX and PHEAA 's Fed Loan Servicing. It is like they do n't want me to make the XXXX necessary payments. At no time have they put me in a past due state when the numbers did n't match up. Serious attention should be given to this, as a lot of people are going to be putting in for XXXX starting in XXXX XXXX.

I am moving out of state to start a XXXX and care for my aging parents. I needed a forbearance for 3 months until school started as I would not have any income to make payments after I moved and prior to my new program. I contacted my lender 2 months in advance and asked what was available. Even knowing I would not have a job BUT that my income would resume ( I have documentation attesting that I have a salaried position beginning when I start my XXXX in the XX/XX/2016 ), they informed me that I would have to pay or have my credit downgraded. I asked about partial payments, interest only payments, and any other programs. They pleasantly informed me that there was nothing they could do. I have worked XXXX for ten years, getting paid much less than my counterparts doing work that is intended to assist those who can not help themselves. Even still, my credit is near perfect ; I have not missed or been late on payments ; and if I have an issue I have always contacted them to adjust payment due dates, etc. I have been a good customer and want to pay what I owe. The fact that I can verify my future income and have an excellent payment and credit history has not made a difference. 

Additionally, a couple of years ago I joined the military and was XXXX XXXX for XXXX months. Prior to and during that time, I tried to work with the lender to have my payments reduced, postponed or suspended while I was away. Eleven months later I received notices from my lenders that I was approved. I had continued paying up until that time because I did not want problems with the lenders or my credit because I had not heard from them. So my SCRA benefits were effectively unavailable to me. Now when I asked to use the time I was approved for that I did not get to use because of their unexplained delays, I am told that it is too late and I should have used it then. How is that possible? I can not use what you do not make available to me. I am not going to incur irreparable harm because of their failures. This is unacceptable. Even when I am entitled to assistance, they refuse to assist me! 

Something must be done. I do n't deserve to have my credit ruined because I want to support my parents and have achieved a milestone ( gained admittance to a Ph.D. Program all expenses paid with a salary ). While my situation is nowhere near as dire as that of others, I do not want to fail to follow through on my commitments. The crazy thing is, if this was a mortgage or credit card there would be options available to me. These same companies offer those services and options to me as a customer with a different product, but as a student somehow my needs and responsibilities are different. If I was of a different mind, I would let it go and never bother to pay them, knowing I have a job and a house and a car and can get around having negative credit. These backward and aggressive financial practices does not do the economy or our current and future workforces any good. We never should have bailed out these companies, especially since, when we need bail outs, ones that we can guarantee we can pay back, they are unwilling to help. As a taxpayer, consumer, and productive citizen I should get at the very least what these businesses get. There is no justice, no equality, no protection for me. Instead, my good service is ignored, my timely payment history is of no consequence, but my tax dollars are necessary to support institutions that do not support me. I request action.

I am very distressed to find that AES has not requested the removal of late payment information in my credit profile due to its damaging effects on my good credit standing. After receiving a forbearance that was backdated to cover the dates my payments were originally considered late, AES has refused to update my credit reports, all the while instituting a new policy which includes the removal of negative credit reporting for student loan accounts that received back-dated forbearances and deferements after XX/XX/XXXX. Since the late payments were posted to my credit report XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX, the company refuses to remove these late payments from my credit report. 
I have requested numerous times for the removal of these late payments from my credit report through written mail, email, and repeated telephone calls to both AES and the Office of the Ombudsman explaining that I have worked extremely hard to keep my credit in good standing and I do not feel these late payments truly reflect my credit worthiness. 
During my approved forbearance period, no payments were due and therefore no payments could be considered late.

Their website is slow and old. I ca n't easily access information such as contact info, documents, payments, etc. It 's a functional atrocity. The only online convenience they offer is payment, but sending in and processing forms must still be done by hand and postal mail. If I need to call they have limited hours, based on eastern time ( So living on the west coast makes it even more inconvenient for me ). 
If I email, send a payment, or basically try to contact them in any capacity it takes XXXX days for a response/acknowledgement. That 's IF they choose to respond. There have been numerous times where my payments simply did n't go through since their system just does n't make much sense. 
If I do get responses, it 's usually with major attitude. They try to state the obvious and make me feel dumb and beneath them. They also try to imply that I say things I did not ( even though almost all my correspondence is in email form and I can easily go back and copy/paste my responses ). 
My last correspondence with them resulted in them sending me the wrong paperwork I needed,, acknowledging receipt in email, saying they will process within XXXX business days, and me having to contact them XXXX business days ( XXXX weeks later ) only to receive the, "" You have the wrong form '' response. 
Last year it took them XXXX months to file a deferment on my accounts. XXXX MONTHS. Of which I assumed they had already applied it. They never contacted me to say my accounts were delinquent when they should have been in deferment, resulting in me and my cosigner with giant hits on our credit reports, and only after repeatedly complaining and threatening with a lawsuit did anyone ever respond to me that had an actual email address and extension. Even then it was thrilling if she even acknowledged my existence. 

Handling my accountMy account has been bought and sold countless times so far. The original lender is bankrupt. They sold off assets to XXXX companies, who bankrupted and sold to XXXX, who sold it back to those companies, who sold it some mysterious company named XXXX XXXX. When I received notices of these actions, it was just barely in time to question them. When I questioned the sale to XXXX and sending a debt validation request, only ACS responded with old information from the first lender. This also took them an incredible amount of time, yet somehow just shy of the deadline for such requests. 
I was also denied a response when I asked them to tell me why my interest rates change up and down so drastically. No clear answer on that, just pages of numbers and math XXXX XXXX would have trouble with. Of course I ca n't even contact this XXXX XXXX, only ACS will handle things. 

Other things : They have also called my cosigner, my mother, and said some nasty things to her, all because someone made a mistake on their end with handling payments and repayment periods. Not appreciated at all. 
If I have to talk to a collections officer, they are very rude and leave indecipherable voicemails to call them back ( at my inconvenience ). Again, not appreciated. The level of hostility is too much, and they seem to not be able to coordinate between their accounts and billing departments. 

I think I have most of it here. I have to admit I have become hostile as well a couple of times, but my level of tolerance versus the frustration is extreme here. It takes a lot to tick me off that badly.

7/3/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"Over the last few months I have had a very difficult time in dealing with my student loan financer- Nelnet . 
I currently have a student loan balance of XXXX and am on a PAYE repayment plan with a loan recertification date of XX/XX/XXXX. 
Submitting my loan recertification paperwork is very important to do in a timely manner. Due to the importance of timely recertification I submitted my recertification application and proof of income on XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX prior to completing my taxes. My husband and I were not yet sure if we were going to file together or separately. I submitted the required income documentation and paperwork stating that we were filing together which of course results in a higher loan payment but my priority at that time was recertifying my loan on time to avoid interest capitalization and I would deal with changing the loan payment later if our filing status changed. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called Nelnet to explain that I would like to change my filing status to filing separately because that is how we ended up filing. Nelnet sent me a prefilled out form upon my request so that I could resubmit my paperwork since my husband and I had ended up deciding to file separately. NOTE : I was instructed PER ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYESS that this was the correct way to submit this documentation and the application was actually PREFILLED BY ONE OF THEIR EMPLOYEES. I am attaching the prefilled application. 
I received a letter XX/XX/XXXX stating that my loan payment would be {$1100.00}. Nothing was wrong at this time as that is the appropriate payment for if my husband and I filed together. I called Nelnet on XX/XX/XXXX to let them know I ended up filing separately and would be resubmitting the paperwork needed for filing separately. 
I submitted the required documentation on XX/XX/XXXX via fax which included the prefilled PAYE recertification paperwork stating that we had filed separately. I included a self-certified letter of my income as well as a copy of my husbands tax return which stated that we filed separately. Although not necessary I even submitted my paystubs to ensure they would have everything they could need to recalculate my payment. 

XX/XX/XXXX XXXX pm called Nelnet because I got an email that said action was needed. I Spoke to XXXX she said no further action needed and I would not be overdue for re certification, they have all papers needed. I I was led to believe that I had now submitted everything properly to have my loan recalculated in time for the XX/XX/XXXX payment which was when the new payment was to start. 
XX/XX/XXXX: - I called Nelnet to follow up and make sure the paperwork was in and that my loan payment had been recalculated to the correct amount ( the amount it should be based on my income and filing separately since all paperwork was in ). The woman I spoke to REPEATEDLY assured me everything was in, it looked good and my loan payment would be about {$410.00}. I told her this sounded incorrect as that was my current payment and due to an increase in my income I should be going up by about a couple hundred dollars. She again assured me everything was good and not to worry. 
Since I had been told several times everything was in order and I was very busy with work, caring for my sick mother, and XXXX XXXX obligations, I did not call daily and check my loan status daily as I dont feel that should be necessary. 
XX/XX/XXXX : I received an email stating my loan payment would be {$1100.00}. I called Nelnet and told them this was incorrect as my husband and I had ended up filing separately and I had resubmitted the paperwork as I was instructed to to recalculate based on filing separately. The man I spoke with said it looks like the problem was that on the previous application the box for recertification not recalculation had been checked ( NOTE THIS IS THE BOX THAT WAS PREFILLED OUT BY THEIR EMPLOYEE WHO SAID THAT WAS THE CORRECT ONE ). He said just correct that and it would be no big deal, recalculations are done quickly and it may even be done prior to the XX/XX/XXXX payment. He also told me that I DID NOT need to send in my husbands tax information since we filed separately. 
When refilling out the paperwork I felt concerned based on the wording that I DID need to send my husbands information so I called Nelnet to check. The person I spoke with said YES, it will not be used in the calculation but it needs to be sent. Somewhere in this conversation it came up that my interest on my loan may capitalize if I submit a payment RECALCULATION request. I said that sounded wrong to me it is not one of the reasons interest capitalized on the PAYE plan and that I have a right to have my payment recalculated to the proper amount without penalty. 
I was put through to someone higher who said she just didnt know for sure if my interest would capitalize or not if my payment was recalculated so basically I would just have to wait and see after submitting my request. I said that was unacceptable when I have a nearly {$300000.00} loan and those are not thing I can just wait and see about as it would greatly affect my loan and my finances and future. She put me on hold and checked with someone and came back and said I was correct and a recalculation would definitely NOT cause any interest to capitalize. 
I resent all of the paperwork that day, XX/XX/XXXX via email. 
I heard nothing so assumed everything was good and thought there was a chance my new payment would be recalculated by XX/XX/XXXX but if not, definitely by XX/XX/XXXX and I was ok with making one month of the higher payment. 
As my XX/XX/XXXX payment date approached I had received nothing about a new payment so I called to check in on everything. I was first told that the reason it was wrong was that I was supposed to check the box in the application that said I am married but do not have access to my husbands income information. I said no, that would be lying on a federal form, I check the married box and then later check a box that says we file our taxes separately. She said oh yea, you are right. Then she said the problem was that I had submitted my husbands pre amended taxes that said we filed separately. I took ownership for that mistake and said I would resubmit everything including the correct taxes On this same phone call I asked about the recalculation and interest capitalization because I did not feel confident with the answer previously. This woman then said also your whole loan is to recertify in 2 days so ALL of your interest is going to capitalize. I was nearly in tears at this point and said my account says its due XX/XX/XXXX. She said thats not what she was seeing there and I asked to speak to higher management. 
She put me through and that woman said it was ok my loan was ot recertify XX/XX/XXXX. She said she just couldnt say for sure however if my interest would capitalize if my loan payment was recalculated. 

I submitted all of the correct paperwork ( at least what I was told was correct ) at that time and told the woman I felt very disappointed in the different information I get every time I speak to someone at Nelnet. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I called to check in on the resent information. At first I was told it was wrong because it was turbo tax which was not accepted but then he said actually what I sent was ok. 
He then told me that just so I am aware, this would unlikely be recalculated by the XX/XX/XXXX payment. When I was previously told it would be done if I had information in a month early. This would mean another month of making a higher payment that I should based on my income and filing status. 
Each time I talk to these people I am told completely different information, some of it causing EXTREME distress- such as saying that my loan is to recertify in 2 days and all of my interest will capitalize when in reality it is not due for another 10 months. Also, going back and forth on telling my that by reCALCULATING my payment to the correct one my interest would capitalize. I have spoken to several upper management who apologize yet do nothing. 
I would like my loan recalculating prior to the XX/XX/XXXX payment if possible. This is not and should not be a complicated process and I have spent countless hours trying to deal with a company that truly seems like they have no idea what they are doing and has no appreciation for what it means to have student loan numbers of this magnitude and how small mistakes can contribute to great amount of money in the life on my loan. 
I have tried very hard to get the correct information to them in a timely manner but it is not possible when I am consistently told incorrect information. I have been severely mislead several times leading to making 2 months of higher payments than I should be. I feel they have no consequences for providing poor and incorrect information and I, the consumer have to pay the consequences. 



These are emails I sent to myself when I realized I should start documenting my conversations with them. Im sorry they are not great, I will from here on out be keeping detailed records of all conversations. 


XX/XX/XXXX : spoke to man that said my loan was not recalculated yet because i sent in my husbands tax information which is not needed because we filed separately. I asked to speak to a supervisor. I got on line with __________ she said the problem is that i filled out my application wrong and said I put that I filed jointly. I pulled up my application which is checked that I filed separately from my spouse.She said no you needed to check the bx that says you are married but can not access spouse info. I said that would be lying and I checked the box that said "" married ''. She said, oh yea, actually that is ok but the problem is your tax return says you filed together. I agreed that was wrong and said I will send in the correct one. 

Then she said my loan re certification date is in 2 days and my interest would capitalize. I said no my recert date is XXXX and i need to talk to a supervisor. I talked to XXXX who said she can not promise my interest would not capitalize with a repayment. I would need to speak with the department of education and that the other person was wrong and my recertification is XX/XX/XXXX, as I said. 

XX/XX/XXXX : I talked to someone and he said the reason my payment is high is it was calculated off of my original recert which said filing together so the following paperwork I sent was ignored because it should have been filed as recalculation paperwork. I was told at this time I do not need to submit my spouse 's tax returns Spoke to XXXX Called back to confirm I Do not need to send marks tax returns because the paperwork makes it seem like I do even thought it would be used. The man I checked with said he would check on it and if I don't get paperwork in by XX/XX/XXXX my interest would capitalize. I said my re certification date was XX/XX/XXXX, and I was told by numerous people at nelnet over the last month that my paperwork was complete and in on time and re-certification was ok. 

I was put on hold while he followed up on this. He came back and said to send in my spouse 's income. And become I am applying for a lower payment my interested may capitalize. I asked to speak to someone about this. 

Transfered. 
I recorded this part of the call I have an audio recording that is too large to upload but I can find a way to so do if needed. 


XX/XX/XXXX : Talked to lady at XXXX who repeatedly confirmed I am up to date they have everything tHey need and it looks like my payment will be about XXXX.

However, she suggested that it is MY responsibility to update personal contact information with MOHELA. Branding me with culpability was premature and unnecessary. As it happens, I am on a temporary job assignment with XXXX, my employer of approximately 5 years. I am out-of state sporadically for work and I requested forwarding for all applicable XXXX addresses to XXXX  so that I would not miss any mail.

The monthly bill statement was inaccurate, as that shows that I have zero eligible Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) payments. This is totally inaccurate and does not reflect my eligible payments! 

By letter dated XX/XX/2018 ; I was informed that XXXX XXXX was selected to manage my federally owned student loans. In that letter I was informed that I could expect to hear back from the organization no sooner that 90 days from XX/XX/2018. As of XX/XX/XXXX, which is Friday, it will have been 90 since days since I received that letter. How can the organization portray on my initial monthly bill, that I have zero qualified PSLF payments, when I have yet to receive a report on their analysis of my past payment history? 

This will actually be the 2nd complaint that I will have submitted about XXXX, in the short amount of time that I have been dealing with their organization. My initial concern, started after I received my initial communication from XXXX by letter dated XX/XX/2018 ; stating that I did not have any eligible loan types. This was inaccurate and not correct, as I received an additional letter from XXXX, dated XX/XX/2018, stating that in fact, I was eligible for the program, and that my employment had been certified. This is very disconcerting and causes me great concern about future dealings with XXXX!!!! 

My most current concern, is that I received a letter ( dated XX/XX/2018 ) saying that the XXXX organization had approved a Disaster Forbearance on my behalf. I never have, nor did I requested a Disaster Forbearance. This should be cancelled ASAP.

8/10/18,Student loan,Private student loan,Getting a loan,Problem with the interest rate,"I have been comparing different private student loan options to help finance the rest of my XXXX ( XXXX ) program. The online advertising shows a fixed-rate APR range starting at 5.99 % for interest only in-school payments and 6.59 % for $ XXXX/mo fixed in-school payment and deferred payment. The website clearly states : "" Private student loans are credit based. '' which is completely understandable. I have a 780+ credit score ( verified throughout the years as I have applied for various credit from credit cards to mortgages ). When applying for loans, I always get the lowest rate because I have excellent credit with no blemishes and a long history. 

When I applied today ( XX/XX/2018 ), one of the questions they asked was if I am full time or part time. I am a full time student. Then they asked my income and assets ( non-retirement and retirement ). Although I was confused why they needed this since I am full-time in school and not working, I gave them my income for the year ( my internship over the summer ) and my assets ( more than enough to cover the loan if I had to make withdrawals from my retirement ). Once they had my information and ran my credit, they told me my interest rate would be over 8 % APR for my {$44000.00} student loan! When I asked why, they kept saying that they factor my credit into the decision, but when pressed, the rep finally confessed that they consider current income! I'm a full-time graduate student ... I don't have a job. If I did, I wouldn't need student loans. When I graduate, I will be making more than enough to pay back the loans and may even have a job offer by next week for when I graduate. Job offers for future employment aren't considered though. Only current annual income.

There is no mention ( at least that I could find within hours of researching ) of needing income or proof of income to qualify or get the best interest rate. Clearly Discover is playing bait and switch. They wanted me to have a cosigner and then they would still only go down to as low as 7 % APR if I agreed to add a cosigner ( 1.01 % higher than the lowest advertised rate ). I doubt anyone can "" qualify '' for their stated lowest rate of 5.99 %. This is false advertising! I cancelled the application without accepting funding.

I no longer want to do business with Discover and I will be sure to guide other students and professionals away from them for all products they offer.",,DISCOVER BANK,TN,372XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,8/10/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2988206

3/8/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Don't agree with the fees charged,"On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, my student loan server. Originally, I was calling because I had questions regarding how filing jointly or separately with my husband would impact my income driven repayment program. At that time, however, the customer service agent informed me that Great Lakes had placed me on the incorrect repayment plan. Initially, the agent informed me that switching back to the REPAYE program would result in the capitalization of any unpaid interest. After determining that the switch was Great Lakes error, however, I was told that interest would not be capitalized. 

On or about XX/XX/XXXX, I followed-up with Great Lakes to confirm that I had been placed back on the REPAYE program. Unfortunately, at that time, a different customer service agent informed me that Great Lakes had simply updated my PAYE program. Consequently, I was required to re-explain the situation to that agent who, after an hour, assured me that she would switch me back to the REPAYE program. During that time, obviously I also wanted to confirm once again, that I would not be penalized for switching back to the REPAYE program, because it was a result of Great Lakes error. It was at that point, that the customer service agent informed me that interest would not be capitalized as a result of switching me back to the correct repayment program, however, interest would be capitalized because, at that time, they determined that I did not submit my repayment application on time. After reassuring the agent for more than an hour that I had submitted my application on time, which is why interest had previously not been capitalized, she determined I was correct, and again I was told interest would not be capitalized. Further, regarding the above late renewal application, Great Lakes records will show that I contacted them in XX/XX/XXXX and was informed that my renewal application was due in XX/XX/XXXX. In addition, I never received any prior communication from Great Lakes stating that my renewal application was not timely, and thus up to that point interest had not been capitalized. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received an email from Great Lakes stating that all unpaid interest had been capitalized. Obviously, this email prompted me to again contact Great Lakes. At that time, I was told that capitalization is the automatic result of switching back to the REPAYE program. That being said, because the capitalization was a direct result of Great Lakes error, they would go back and manually remove all capitalized interest. At the end of this conversation, I was told to follow-up with Great Lakes after XX/XX/XXXX to confirm all capitalized interest had been removed. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed-up with Great Lakes regarding the above. At that time, I was told that Great Lakes had removed less than {$1000.00} of capitalized interest. Remembering that the original total was approximately {$8000.00}, however, I questioned the amount that had been removed. In addition, I referred to my account to confirm the amount was approximately {$8000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. It was at that point, that I discovered Great Lakes had changed the interest capitalization dates from XX/XX/XXXX for an amount exceeding {$8000.00} to XX/XX/XXXX for a capitalized interest in the amount of {$5700.00}, and XX/XX/XXXX for a capitalized interest amount of {$1000.00}. It was at this point, I was again told that Great Lakes retroactively capitalized interest as of XX/XX/XXXX because I allegedly submitted my repayment application late. Unfortunately, however, although I again informed yet another customer service agent that I did not file my application late, I was told Great Lakes would not remove the above-capitalized interest. Instead, I was informed they would only follow-up regarding the remaining {$1000.00} that still reflects the XX/XX/XXXX date. 

Clearly, given the above, I am filing this complaint because I do not believe I should be responsible for any capitalized interest currently on my account. With that said, I am also motivated to file this complaint for several other reasons. First, I must believe I am not the only person who, through no fault of their own, has been incorrectly assigned the wrong repayment program. Further, because correcting this issue results in the automatic capitalization of any unpaid interest, I am also certain I am not the only person who now has interest capitalized on their account as a direct result of this accidental reassignment. Second, although Great Lakes had the opportunity to resolve all of the above, they instead decided to take that opportunity to change the source of the capitalization to allegedly filing my renewal application late. An occurrence which they did not determine until this incident occurred. Third, {$1000.00} of capitalized interest which Great Lakes now attributes solely to the switching of my repayment program still remains on my account, and although Great Lakes agrees I am not responsible for this amount, it is unclear if they intend to remove it.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,GREAT LAKES,CA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/8/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2837822

7/12/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"In XX/XX/XXXX my loans were transferred to XXXX  from XXXX because I signed up for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program as a XXXX XXXX. In XXXX they notified me that my monthly payment would be over {$850.00} which I can not afford ( I was always paid ahead on XXXX and never had such a high payment, but that started over with XXXX  ). I switched to the PAYE program in XXXX and request a reduced payment forbearance ( {$5.00} ) for XXXX. They sent a letter stating they would send a bill for {$5.00} but NOT to pay the {$5.00} until I received the bill. I waited and waited. Twice I called XXXX to see where my bill was but they insisted that I should NOT pay the {$5.00} until I get the bill otherwise it would go towards my balance and not towards the change in payment plans. I never received the bill. I have screenshots and proof that I never received the bill. Eventually, on a third attempt to contact XXXX to ask where the bill was, the customer service rep I spoke with said my bill was overdue and I was disapproved for the PAYE because I was late paying the bill and would now go back on full standard payment schedule. I protested and they said they would resubmit the payment plan request. However, because I was "" late '' paying the bill, I could not afford the XXXX bill of  {$850.00} so I had to request a forbearance again. After this forbearance ended, XXXX capitalized my interest in the amount of {$720.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I again protested that it was the fault of XXXX that I was late paying my bill and thus forced to request a forbearance. The manager I spoke with that day agreed and submitted a request to the U.S. Department of Education to reverse the interest capitalization. The request was submitted XX/XX/XXXX. It was approved XX/XX/XXXX. Several customer service reps I spoke with all acknowledged the approval. I have it in writing that they acknowledged it. First I was told that it would take 30 days to show on my account. After 30 days and no change, I called again. Then I was told it would actually take 90 days to reflect on my account. After 90 days I called again. Then I was told that they could see the approved reversal in the system but that there must be an issue causing it not to reflect on the account. We are now in XX/XX/XXXX. The person that day told me it would take about 72 hours to reflect on my account and that she would call me back in a week. A week goes by with no call. I call again and was told that if someone said they would call me back that I should wait until I get a call back. After another week and some change I called on XX/XX/XXXX. At this point, the woman on the phone told me that a review was completed on XX/XX/XXXX and that my request to reverse the interest capitalization was denied. After being told several times by customer service representatives since XXXX that the request was approved and will be reversed soon, that it was a matter of time or a matter of a technical glitch, I was being told completely opposite information that it was denied. I never at any point received correspondence or an explanation about the request, the decision, what to expect, or what the next steps were throughout this entire process and all correspondence on the issue was initiated by me. Every month that the interest capitalization is not reversed despite it's approval, I gain interest on a principal amount that is inaccurate due to the XXXX system never sending me a bill in XXXX. It has been 5 months now which means the {$720.00} has accrued {$180.00} in interest and will continue to collect interest until it is resolved. The lack of communication and random unexplained sudden denial of a process that was approved back in XXXX is unfair, inaccurate, and quite frankly is just pure theft.",,AES/PHEAA,FL,346XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,7/12/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2961372

My lawyer contacted their lawyer and was told the problem was fixed. I would send them money, they would send it back ( I have bank statements to back this up ).  After over a year I stopped sending money to force them to contact me so we could settle the issue. They never did. Ten years later in XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from Navient that my forbearance was approved and that payments would start in XX/XX/XXXX, however I now owe {$130000.00}, {$880.00} a month for 30 years.

I never asked for a forbearance, especially one that lasted ten years. I was never notified of the change in address to forward payments when Sallie Mae switched to Navient.

The first representative I spoke to in the early afternoon told me that since I included my parent plus loans in the consolidation, I was ineligible for REPAYE. He offered that the loans could be reviewed and that I could combine mine with my husband 's which would result in a lower payment. My husband contacted XXXX later in the day and was told that this was not possible. I called last night and it being not possible was confirmed by a Supervisor. I was told it can be reviewed since it affects our income and there was a possibility it would change my monthly payments but probably not by much. I was informed during both phone calls that an another option would be to file my taxes separately but can't understand why this was mentioned to me at such a late date. Please keep in mind that I have been contacting XXXX in regards to my extremely high debt since XXXX. The repayment plan they assigned me basically is 20 % of mine and my husband 's income and takes no consideration into our bills, his student loan payments, etc. They advertise options to help people who have difficulty paying but to date it appears the only options are to defer which only incurs more interest and debt.",,AES/PHEAA,NY,126XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/27/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,3030907

Information that was not pertinent to determining my earnings ( my pay rate, employee ID # ) as well as my account # for my bills, VIN # for my cars were also blacked out this is something that I have done with previous hearings. I received a letter from the hearing officer stating my claim was denied because I put N/A for questions like spouse income when I clearly stated that I am SINGLE so a spouses income does not pertain to me, I also stated household total as 1 which is ONLY me so there was no other income to report. It also stated that I submitted something that appeared to be a car not payment form, the form clearly shows the make and model of the car along with the bank that I make payments to and the amount of the payment which is {$510.00} the only thing blacked out was my VIN # & account # both things that weren't relevant to what the bill was as well as the payment that is due monthly. I sent a copy of the front page of my lease agreement that states what my rent is monthly ( {$600.00} ) but the officer stated that it was a unsigned lease agreement, the page with our signatures DO NOT show what I pay a month so I did not include that page. I also included what I pay a month in car insurance for my vehicles ( {$160.00}, {$330.00} ) and the officers response was a sense of confusion like they had no idea why I was paying insurance for my vehicles and to date I have had to cancel the insurance on one of my vehicles because of the wage garnishment I could no longer afford it.

I immediately contacted Navient in hopes of securing a payment arrangement that would bring the accounts current. I was presented with a large monthly payment of {$1100.00} and I asked for a reduced payment plan based on my income ; which is what I was receiving for my Federal Student Loans with the Department of Education. Navient agreed and bought the payments down to $ XXXX monthly for all XXXX loans. Upon payment received by Navient, they were still reporting to all XXXX credit bureaus that I was delinquent. I 've disputed these late payments and accounts with both Navient and Navient Solutions several times over the past 3 years. I have not been successful.

It wasnt until recently I found out I could apply to have my original loan cancelled by the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX under the borrowers defense due to the schools fraud. I contacted the XXXX XXXX XXXX last week and was informed that I do not have a defaulted loan with them and would not be able to apply for cancellation of the debt because they show the loan paid off in XX/XX/XXXX.
What I was able to discover, and now realize, is that in XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by a representative from XXXX XXXX with an offer to get me out of federal default status by loan consolidation. I agreed to the offer in hopes to get some relief. No one from XXXX XXXX ever told me that by doing this my XXXX XXXX XXXX loan would then be considered a private loan. No one ever informed me of the statue I could avail of due to fraud by the school. Instead I was transitioned and could not maintain the payment schedule. By transitioning my loan to a private loan, I was deprived of my ability for the loan to be cancelled by the XXXX XXXX XXXX. ( Please note originally Navient told me I have a private loan with them. The advocate dept. states however it is a federal loan ).
This has greatly impacted me because the balance now sits at {$28.00}, XXXX and immensely affects my credit rating. I can not move any further in life without getting this resolved. When I first received by disbursement for XXXX College, the payment went directly to the school. There were two loans sent to them. Loan # 1 was a FFEL Supplement Loan for {$2300.00}, and Loan # 2 was a FFEL Stafford Subsidized Loan for {$2600.00}. This is a total of {$4900.00}. My life is indebted now for almost {$30000.00} and I have received nothing in return that will enrich me or allow me to benefit from. I was a victim of an unscrupulous organization.
Unfortunately, due to catastrophic events in my life including XXXX sick children ( out of XXXX  ), husband becoming addicted to drugs, divorce and being laid off over 4 times, I have done the best I can to just survive. This has been the biggest challenge. I have filed bankruptcy twice in my life in an effort to merely sustain. Most recently I was unemployed from XX/XX/XXXXXX/XX/XXXX. I have been employed since XX/XX/XXXX in a lower level position in XXXX XXXX and am still rebounding.
I am XXXX years old and currently paying off a bill to the IRS. There is no way I will be able to pay over {$28000.00} to Navient. I feel as if I am being held hostage. I can reopen my last bankruptcy ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and petition the judge for this debt to be relieved through an adversary proceeding. However, I am reaching out to you for help with issue to see if there is a way this debt can be cancelled. Your representatives have petitioned me with a payment plan in the amount of {$28.00}, XXXX that will not help my situation in any way and that is their only offer.
Please let me know if there is any other alternative. I can be reached at XXXX.
Thank you for your time.

4/16/16,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are handled,"Last month I received a letter from Navient stating that there was an error in my consolidated loan- that the XXXX loans within the consolidation loan had different repayment schedules and that Navient was going to automatically switch my repayment schedule to the longest possible. The letter indicated if I wanted a different repayment schedule, I simply had to call Navient. I called the next day ( approx XXXX XXXX ), and tried to get the repayment schedule back to my previous schedule. This proved extremely difficult- the first call I could not reach a representative through any of the automated choices, and when I finally did reach a rep, she had to transfer me to a different section. I proceeded to wait on hold for approx 10 minutes and then instead of speaking to someone to assist me, I was instead connected to a satisfaction survey which asked about my experience. Considering I received absolutely no assistance, I would say the experience was pretty unsatisfying. So, I tried again, and reached a human fairly quickly, one who assured my the change request had been added to the account and that my next monthly payment would remain the same and not revert to the lower payment/longer payment schedule. I assumed this would be the case and I did not request verification in writing. Unfortunately, this month 's monthly payment just came out and I see that the lower amount ( corresponding to the longer repayment schedule ) was made and not back to my normal payment amount. 

I understand that the XXXX repayment schedules may not have matched up within the consolidation loan, and this may be a requirement, but I do n't see why it 's necessary for Navient to revert the consumer automatically to the longer repayment schedule since this inevitably costs the borrower more in interest. And what I really do n't understand is why it 's so difficult for a borrower to contact Navient and have the payment changed back to what the borrower originally wanted ( and had been paying without incident for over 10 years. ) I think it 's disingenuous to change a borrower 's repayment schedule without their consent- but it 's even more egregious to make it difficult, if not impossible, for the consumer to change it back to the option that will ultimately save the consumer thousands in interest.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",DC,200XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/16/16,Closed with explanation,Yes,Yes,1883317

5/17/15,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Received bad information about my loan,"I would like to report a case of student loan fraud by Wells Fargo Student Services. I recently graduated from XXXX University XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I took out a loan with Wells Fargo in XXXX 2014 and contacted representatives with questions several times during my loan process. I was informed on several occasions that my loan would not accrue interests and that I was not permitted to make any payment on my loan amount until my 6 month deferment period was over. Specifically, I contacted Wells Fargo representatives twice and was explicitly informed that I was "" not permitted '' to make any payments on my student loan while I was still enrolled in school. 

I called on XXXX separate occasions to verify this statement and this claim was never contradicted. I also asked to receive a copy of my promissory agreement to verify this claim and never received one. 

I finally reached a representative last week who informed me that not only had my loan been accruing interest, but that I was able to submit payments on my loan the entire time. 

Since then, I have contacted Wells Fargo several times, and none of my requests have been met. I am yet to receive a copy of my promissory agreement. I was informed that Wells Fargo management can not accept responsibility for their employees poor information and I was told that I most likely misunderstood the difference between the phrases "" do not have to make payments '' and "" can not make payments ''. However, on XXXX separate occasions I was specifically told I was "" not permitted '' to make a payment, suggesting that it was their representatives who may have been confused about the meaning of the standard Wells Fargo verbiage. 

During several conversations with Wells Fargo management, they emphasized that their loan specialists most likely informed me that I was not "" obligated '' to pay back a loan but could do so at any time. This was not the case, although the phrase "" do n't have to pay off the loan while you are enrolled in school '' frequently came up. Although I explicitly asked about concurrently paying off my loan, this frequently repeated expression is potentially -- and likely intentionally -- misleading. The manager I spoke with informed me that an internal complaint is the "" best they could do '' for my situation ; in the meantime, their confusion has cost me approximately {$1500.00} in interest-related fees on my loan. 

Furthermore, I am still unable to access my online account despite multiple calls to Wells Fargo technical support. I conduct online banking for all my other accounts, and do not have an issue accessing my Wells Fargo Mortgage online account. Essentially, this is not user error- I am specifically unable to access my student loan portal and have not received any support from Wells Fargo in this regard. 

My husband and I are both XXXX ; I recently transferred over tot he XXXX XXXX. While we understand consumer responsibility, we sought clarification on written documents throughout the process and received none. Additionally, we explicitly asked for additional information that we never received. My attempts at contacting management were infructuous at best ; I am still waiting on an email containing our promissory agreement as an attachment or a way to defray our interest by transmitting my husband 's military orders. 

I believe that Wells Fargo 's loan department is intentionally misleading potential customers and withholding information about the terms of their loans and hope this report can coerce Wells Fargo to clarify their lending practices and information dissemination.",Company chooses not to provide a public response,WELLS FARGO & COMPANY,MD,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,5/17/15,Closed with explanation,Yes,No,1379500

I never finished my training nor was I close to being able to get a job XXXX. XX/XX/XXXX as they were shutting down so was our economy. XXXX XXXX flooded the market with highly qualified, high hour instructors. Even though I did n't get my XXXX and had to pay for it out of pocket I never had the chance to receive instrument rating which at this point in the economy would be highly essential in getting a job. I was basically a nobody, and without having {$15000.00} dollars to pay for it I 'm probably not going to be able to ever qualify for another loan to finish my training. The way the lender looks at this now is a "" graduated '' situation and the loan is now activated. Originally the loan was at 15 % interest rate, $ XXXX monthly payment deferred until XXXX. I knew I could n't afford it, definitely not on a XXXX wage but the ultimate plan obviously was to become a XXXX. I started to research to see if I could refinance it and came across XXXX XXXX. The new payment then would be $ 500 monthly at a 5 % rate and it was at least manageable. My wife and I, at the time, had a son XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. Our daughter went through many XXXX after birth including a XXXX for nearly a year. Medical bills were racking up as we continued to pay for the student loan even though I never graduated.

I XXXX XX/XX/XXXX and again XX/XX/XXXX to XXXX. Still we did n't make enough money to even keep up with staggering bills so we decided to file bankruptcy. We only agreed to go forward with it because our lawyer told us the school loan would be discharged. Well, that did n't happen. We wanted to sue the attorney for the malpractice but since he did n't carry insurance that was a dead end. The attorney told us to stop making payments since we were going to file anyway. The loan amount after "" graduation '' was {$75000.00} and after this stunt it 's now around {$100000.00}. Here we are now, XX/XX/XXXX and the loan is due in full. My wife divorced me over it. I would like to say I 'm fully responsible for the loan, what states in the divorce decree, but she 's a cosigner. Creditors do n't care what the decree states so they 're threatening judgment and wage garnishments. I ca n't afford a {$500.00} dollar payment and it 's not right that they should go after her. I have spoken to the department of consumer protection, the department of education, the XXXX, the city and attorney general 's office, the FTC and one of the best bankruptcy lawyers in XXXX and so far no one has an answer for me.

My wife and I have been married for 7 years and have XXXX children, XXXX and XXXX, ages XXXX and XXXX. XXXX has XXXX and, as result, we XXXX our children to protect her from the many XXXX she is prone to in public environments. My wife used to XXXX but is now a full-time XXXX mommy. As result, I am the sole income earner of our household. Following my XXXX from the United States XXXX, as a XXXX and XXXX, I went to school to earn my XXXX with my G.I. Bill and then continued onward to a XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX to establish an education more applicable to my chosen career field. I found myself immersed in learning and desired to push further and work towards my XXXX in XXXX. The college advised that I had enough remaining loan to complete this degree, however, about 60 % through the program they advised I had reached my student loan ceiling. As result, I was forced to exit my graduate education and make something of myself. I have now served 2 years in Public Service to the State of Ohio and 5 more years to the US Government. 

I would like to discuss a matter that would have great negative implications for my family and I as result of a simply checking a box without realizing it. As the sole income earner for my family, I have been working toward earning forgiveness of my Federal Student Loans via the Public Safety Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) program. In this program, if you make 10 years of continuous qualifying payments towards your Federal Loan balance, while employed in a qualifying public service, your loans are forgiven. I was 6 years into this program before this checked box erased all of these qualifying payments. 

On XXXX XXXX, 2016, my loan servicer, FedLoan Servicing, mailed me a notice that I was due for the annual re-certification of my Income-Based Repayment Plan. They advised, "" We must receive your application by XXXX/XXXX/2016. If we do not receive your application within 10 days of this date, payment will increase to {$1800.00}, first due on XXXX/XXXX/2016. Re-certify electronically at StudentLoans.gov. '' On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I logged into StudentLoans.gov to re-certify electronically as directed. However, I noticed that a new repayment plan ( pay as you earn ) was now available that afforded even lower payments and applied for that one instead of the current one. I have done this before, as it satisfies the re-certification process, only changing the payment plan. 
On XXXX XXXX, 2016, I returned from a XXXX vacation and collected my mail from an overstuffed box. The following day, as I sorted through my mail, I opened a notice from Fed Loan Servicing advising that I had successfully consolidated my loans and the past 5-6 years of qualifying Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) payments have been erased as result. 

I did not knowingly request a loan consolidation ; I only completed my annual re-certification under a new repayment plan that offered lower payments. As I did not knowingly make this request, I feel it would be fair and right to reverse this consolidation and/or allow my 5-6 years of previously made PSLF qualifying payments to continue to count towards my Loan Forgiveness. 

I have detailed records of contacts I have made to my servicer, FedLoan Servicing, the Department of Education, and their Ombudsman. They have all advised that there is absolutely no cancelling, changing, or reversing a consolidation after 10 days. Furthermore, they advise that all of my qualifying PSLF payments are now forfeited and that this is also irreversible. The Department of Education initially advised I had 30 days to cancel, which I was within, but then their Ombudsman said this was not true.

The loan has since been transferred to Navient for management. 

In XXXX XXXX, I was reviewing my bills and loan accounts like I do every few weeks so I can plan and prepare for upcoming payments. I typically do not focus on the XXXX XXXX Student Loan because it is an account my XXXX is supposed to be paying back, but since she has not been paying on the XXXX XXXX Student Loan, I needed to if I wanted to keep up with my decent credit score. As I was reviewing the account details ( payment history, loan balance, interest paid, principal paid ), I saw something that was a little disturbing, the interest paid amount. 

I looked back at the life of the loan and made notes of some of the numbers. 

The original loan amount was {$9100.00}. As of today, XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, there has been roughly {$8800.00} paid towards interest, and roughly {$5000.00} paid towards the balance of the loan. In total, roughly {$13000.00} has been paid towards this school loan ( XXXX XXXX Student Loan ).
The reason I reference the term "" roughly '' in the above statement is because I can not find this data on Navients website. So I had to download my transaction history and use XXXX to calculate the numbers  above. 

Once I saw the amounts ( loan balance, interest paid, principal paid ) for this loan, I almost had a XXXX XXXX. This loan was being paid XXXX/XXXX/XXXX - XXXX XXXX, and the loan is n't even paid halfway off?? All I could think about is how long will this need to be paid before it gets paid off? Another XXXX years? How much additional money would need paid towards the loan {$10000.00}?? 

I wanted to get a baseline, so I logged into XXXX XXXX Services. This is where I have my own student loans. In XXXX XXXX, I borrowed roughly {$18000.00} to go to school. I did not have to make payments until after I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX. I just paid off my student loans a couple weeks ago. So I thought to myself, how can I borrow twice as much for my student loans and have them paid off in XXXX years, and on the flip-side, pay on the XXXX XXXX Student Loan for XXXX years, and not even pay half of the {$9100.00} balance? I did not understand what happened or how I can have a loan twice as much get paid off, before a loan half the size. 

Since I did not understand what was happening with the XXXX XXXX Student Loan, I called Navient to find out more information and possibly get assistance in some form or another. 

When I called Navient ( XX/XX/XXXX ), I spoke with XXXX individuals. I shared my story with each individual. The story is as follows : "" My XXXX is refusing to pay the loan back so I am forced to pay. I am only able to make the minimum payment since I did not budget the repayment of the XXXX XXXX Student Loan. I wanted help from Navient to ease the stress I was being overwhelmed with over this situation I was now in. I gave the details of the loan ( the original loan amount {$9100.00}, roughly {$8800.00} paid towards interest, and roughly {$5000.00} paid towards the balance of the loan. In total, roughly {$13000.00} has been paid ), and each representative denied me assistance or help on this loan. All they could recommend for me was to make a larger monthly payment so the loan would be paid off sooner. '' I was very unhappy with how the call went. Not only did I not receive any assistance from Navient, I felt like they did n't care about the situation I was in and they just wanted money for this XXXX XXXX Student Loan. 

At this point, I started to review paperworkemails regarding the contract details and the promissory note, but I never found the information on what rate was to be charged for the XXXX XXXX Student Loan. Most of the information I found was telling me how I made a good choice by obtaining the XXXX XXXX Student Loan. Some documents promised that having this type of loan would be beneficial because there were "" interest-only payments and shorter repayment periods designed to save on your overall loan costs ''. 

I was able to find a letter that contained an updated payment schedule, estimating the payoff date would be XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, estimated interest paid to the loan {$5000.00} and total amount to be paid to the loan was estimated at {$14000.00} With all of that being said, I feel like we were scammed into obtaining the XXXX XXXX Student Loan. All of the information about it being a beneficial program and designed to save us money never cam into fruition. The facts are this, XXXX years of paying towards a {$9100.00} loan has left me with this, an interest paid amount of roughly {$8800.00}, principal paid amount of roughly {$5000.00}, and a loan balance of XXXX. 

After XXXX years of paying this loan the amount of interest we have paid is nearly the loan amount requested. Can someone please tell me why I was being directed to obtain a "" XXXX XXXX Student Loan ''? From what I can tell this is not a smart loan to have. 

I believe we were mislead to think that this was a good option for a school loan. Nothing I have seen has proved otherwise.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",PA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,10/23/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2709386

6/21/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I obtained my federal student loans in order to attend XXXX XXXX ( graduating in XXXX ), and I subsequently refinanced them with XXXX. XXXX subsequently sold the loans to XXXX XXXX, who then sold them to Navient. XXXX had a principal payment option electronically available on their web site when they had my notes. Navient has no process to make principal only payments, and refuses to recognize my requests to make them, even though my accounts are on auto payment and in good standing. It seems that if you would like to avoid their archaic repayment system that appears designed to ring every possible cent of profit out of a note, you have to save your extra payments until you have enough in the coffee can to pay them in full. So while the documentation I signed say there is no prepayment penalty, Navient effectively adds one by refusing all pre-payments until the loan is repaid in full at that moment. And they pass this off by saying that it 's the Department of Education 's fault, because they decide the repayment terms. I 'm certain, however, that the Department of Education has not precluded Navient and other firms from accepting principal only payments from customers in good standing unless it comes in a full payoff. The effect of Navient 's position is illogical on its face, and absurd in its impact. This is clearly a profit motive on the part of Navient to deny principal only payments, and I believe they should be held to account. My Navient account number is XXXX, and I am willing to provide statements as required to support my claims. My most recent discussion with Navient took place on a chat board on their site on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX, beginning at XXXX XXXX. This is what that discussion looked like : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I do apologize, all payments are applied to the interest first and then once interest has been satisfied, payments will be applied to principal.

Spoke to a representative in XX/XX/XXXXabout going onto a IDR loan repayment plan. Was told the payments would be around {$150.00} a month. A representative helped me select the ( REPAYE ) option and fill out an application after being told the previous two years no lower monthly paid options are available and I would have to pay over {$500.00} a month even when I just got off of unemployment. Fine. HR verified me the next day and faxed a copy of my application in. I followed up with a copy of my application and proof of income. Fedloan denied my application stating I did not submit proof of income. I uploaded my pay stub and they stated they received it. Nothing happened. Meanwhile, I was told my account was placed on an Administrative forbearance. Kept getting e-mails stating I need to pay over {$500.00}. Called again and the representative stated I was placed on an administrative forbearance and to ignore it. Called again today and this time my account states I owe over {$1000.00}. No forbearance was placed on my account and my IDR still has not been processed. Worst, my account says I am 28 days delinquent. I have never been delinquent on an account in over 10 years. My credit report is all green from on time payments. The representative tells me on the phone that I better make a payment or I will get reported to the credit bureau. That made me angry. I asked to speak to a supervisor. She denied my request and forwarded me instead to another representative who stated I have to pay the {$1000.00} before my REPAYE can be processed. Also, Fedloan keeps telling me I have to pay my immediately yet when I called US Department of Education to ask a question about something unrelated, I was told specifically that its written in the statues that regardless of how much you owe, a student is guaranteed 6 months grace period. I told Fedloan several times and they recognized this and again stated an administrative forbearance is on my account.
It is clear to me that Fedloan Servicing has no plans to honor what is written in statues with the grace period after attending school. They also have been lying to me for the past 4 months stringing me along until I am backed into a corner where I have no choice but pay them instead of paying my rent or car payment which I need to get to work. They are loan sharks. It is also clear they have no intention on processing the REPAYE application that their representative selected and sold to me and even helped me fill out the application.
The representative acknowledged that I am entitled to the grace period because of my student status had me put {$0.00} for payment and {$5.00} maximum payment while the application was being processed.
The representative even apologized to me because my account had accrued {$10000.00} in interest because I could not afford payments since I was paying another private loan that could not be consolidated. She stated I was entitled to lower payments at that time including the period I was unemployed.
I suppose that 's was the whole point to begin with. Have representative promise things they never intended to follow through on and have you accrue addition interest so Fedloan gets more money out of borrowers. Now my credit report is ruined.

This went on for two years. My loans came up for recertification of my IBR plan in XX/XX/XXXXwith XXXX at which time I was given my IBR payment amount of XXXX . I made my first payment to XXXX in the amount of XXXX $ as I was instructed to do. I had been in contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX working through the application for PSLF as I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX employee and had spent the previous 5-6 years employed at qualifying non profit organizations. I spoke with 5 or 6 different XXXX XXXX employees during this period of time asking a million questions as I was constantly getting different answers from the employees. I would be told that I ca n't pay a penny more than my IBR payment amount, I can pay any amount over that I want, all of my loans would qualify, the two loans I have that do n't qualify would n't be a problem I could leave them out of the program and just work towards the PSLF of my other qualifying loans without having to consolidate the loans. That is exactly what I chose to do as it was only two small loans that would n't be in the system. I verified this information several times with XXXX XXXX and was continuously reassured that all of my previous payments would qualify and the consolidation was not necessary to be apart of the program. Never was I instructed that if I did n't consolidate then none of my loans would qualify until I do or I would have taken out a private loan and paid off the two non qualifying loans prior to applying and transferring my loans to XXXX XXXX. Back to XXXX, my payment for XXXX was applied only to one loan instead of to all of them which made the rest of my loans show as past due. I spoke with XXXX about this and they were reissuing the XX/XX/XXXX payment as it was made in error and not my fault. The loans were transferred to XX/XX/XXXXduring this process and this is where things went crazy. I have spent one night every two weeks for no less than an hour on the phone with XXXX XXXX trying to resolve this "" past due '' issue since Beginning of XXXX XXXX. I of course got a different employee of XXXX XXXX XXXX every time I called in and was given a different reason as to why this was going on and how to fix it. I was told by a XXXX XXXXXXXX employee that I had to pay an extra XXXX $ to make up some difference in payment that would fix the past due issue, allow XXXX XXXX to reissue all of my payments since I had been with them and make all payments qualify. That 's exactly what I did. Another 4 months of this goes by with me jumping through countless hoops and given numerous deadlines for when it would be fixed. I sent them my bank statements showing all payments made for the exact amount I was instructed to pay, I sent them letters from XXXX saying I had no payment inXX/XX/XXXX, a letter showing I had a payment dueXX/XX/XXXX from XXXX, I sent them the IBR letter from XXXX detailing what my payment would be based on my income. It is now XXXX and the past due issue has finally been resolved, or so I thought. Last night XX/XX/XXXX I received an e-mail from a XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX informing me that I have made no qualifying payments at all as I did not consolidate my loans with XXXX XXXX. This is something I had spoken with XXXX XXXX about atleast a 1/2 dozen times. I was also informed that my last 6 payments sinceXX/XX/XXXX would not be qualifying payments either as I am no in "" paid ahead '' status. I have made one payment every month since XX/XX/XXXXwith exception of the extra XXXX $ I was instructed to pay by XXXX XXXXXXXX in XXXX I believe to resolve the issue. I have been mislead every step of the way, passed off to worker after worker, I can never speak with a manager as if they do n't exist and I never receive call backs or letters in the mail other than past due notices. I have asked 4 or 5 times for a copy of my case comment log to be mailed to me for my records in proving that this has been an ongoing 6 month issue and I am constantly told they will get that mailed out to me yet it never arrives. I have done everything I was instructed to do by XXXX XXXX to be enrolled in the PSLF program as I am a qualifying government employee and have been for quite some time. I want my qualifying payments to be counted, I do not want the non consolidation to penalize the 29 months of qualifying payments that I have already made to count against me, I do not understand how I can be "" paid ahead '' when I am simply doing what I 'm instructed to do by XXXX XXXX employees themselves. This is not how business is handled and I am fed up with wasting my personal time getting the run around from this XXXX XXXX processor. They are swindling millions of dollars and ruining countless lives in this malpractice. They have breached the terms and conditions of the agreement I signed with them, falsely represented themselves and it is not legal to hold me accountable for misrepresentation, false information and there incompetence. I have made every effort to rectify this directly with XXXX XXXX and I am now seeking legal representation in the matter to file suit against XXXX XXXX XXXX and there parent company Pennsylvania Higher Education. Any help in this matter would greatly be appreciated. I can provide phone logs showing the countless hours I have spent on the phone with XXXX XXXX, I can provide my bank statements detailing my exact payments and dates made, the IBR repayment schedule, and any other documentation that may assist you in rectifying this matter.

I spoke with a Representative who informed me that my IDR wasnt processed and my bills were available through my online account. I asked her why would they NOT email me to inform me of this, yet they emailed me about a forberance so they clearly had my email address. I also let her know how time sensitive and unfair how much this is affecting my life. She advised me that I would have to recomplete a new IDR application and also advised me that I would have to send a letter to the dispute team to get the negative removed from my credit report. I let her know that I did not want a forberance through XXXX as I am prepared to make any upcoming payments and that I would recomplete the application and send in documents to the dispute team.

4/19/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"My original Federal student loans for approximately {$30000.00} when I graduated in XX/XX/XXXX were purchased by XXXX. At the time I was making multiple payments each month for several student loans taken out during the course of my college education. XXXX approached me about consolidating these loans which I agreed to but they also extended the loans from 10 to 15 years which I wasn't aware of and would not have agreed to. So in essence my loan consolidation ( which I agreed to as a convenience also turned into a loan EXTENSION. 

Five years later my XXXX loan ( s ) were purchased by Navient which, after faithfully making payments for the past 12 years, claims I still have a payoff balance of over {$15000.00} which is more than half of what my original student loans were for. I have documentation from Navient showing I have already paid back over {$22000.00} since XX/XX/XXXX. They have not provided me with payment history from XX/XX/XXXXto XX/XX/XXXX which should be around {$12000.00}. 

I dispute that after paying back over {$33000.00} over the past 11+ years that my payoff balance is still another $ XXXX. I have been trying to contact Navient for over 6 months but have been unsuccessfully at being able to get them to answer or return my calls. 

Seeking external assistance I opened a case with the Ombudsman group in XX/XX/XXXX. The person assigned to the case spent the next several months getting Navient to send their documentation. In late XXXX he was able to forward me copies of my loan repayment history from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ( nothing from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX ) along with the XX/XX/XXXX promissory note for my loan consolidation/extension which shows I only consolidated one loan for the amount of {$1000.00} and loan payoff sheets stating that the loan with interest would total approximately {$26000.00} ( I'm unsure of exact number because of the barely legible fax sent by Navient ). 

The Ombudsman case was closed before I had received the documentation and was able to call back with my understanding of the documentation and how it appears to contradict Navient 's claim that I still owe them {$15000.00}. I am in the process of trying to get the case re-opened but have been told it may take up to 30 days and there is no guarantee it will be reopened. 

I have spent the past 6 months unsuccessfully trying to contact Navient and to work the Ombudsman group and I have made zero progress with my dispute. I have found several reports online that Navient has been sued several times for their mishandling of student loans and feel that I may be another victim of the same or similar practices. student loans and poor customer service. 

I am hoping that filing a case with the CFPB might help me with this situation by either forcing Navient to return my calls and to explain how they've handled my loan payments and why my outstanding loan balance is not much closer to being paid off now than when I first started making payments on it over 12 years ago.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NC,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,4/19/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2880565

6/22/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Struggling to repay your loan,Can't get other flexible options for repaying your loan,"My problems with Navient ( previously XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX [ XXXX ] ) have been ongoing since XX/XX/XXXX and have only gotten worse throughout the years. The problems began when a spousal consolidation loan was marketed towards us without full disclosure as to the terms and conditions of the consolidation. There was no clear understanding that if we should divorce, that there would be no way to apportion the liability. Nor was it disclosed that the consolidation would it disqualify me for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ). Perhaps most disturbing was the lack of disclosure concerning financial hardships. At the time that of consolidation, there was no income based repayment ( IBR ), therefore in instances of unemployment or reduced income, we were severely restricted as to our repayment options. When hard times did hit ( and they hit frequently ) we were frequently either not informed or mislead as to what our options were. When my husband 's  payroll checks started bouncing, what was XXXX 's response to postpone payment and avoid default - your only option is to file for a forbearance. When my exhusband was laid off, hat was XXXX 's response to postpone payment and avoid default - your only option is to file for a forbearance. Time and time again, we were pushed in to periods of high interest forbearance. When my husband abandoned my daughters and I, when we were dislocated, and without income, what was XXXX 's response to postpone payment and avoid default - your only option is to file for a forbearance. Repeatedly we were steered towards multiple forbearances instead of income-driven repayment plans or other options. There have been other issues as well, especially after my husband and I divorced. It is practically impossible for me to get IBR paperwork processed without Office of the Customer Advocate. Sometimes I have had to submit the EXACT same paperwork two, three, even four times because they have misplaced it, or because my exhusband and I did n't sign the same piece of paper ( we are on opposite sides of the continent ), or because they did n't process it correctly. Once I was denied my income based repayment because I did not hand write something on a form when there was not a spot on the form for the information and no instructions that the information was needed?!? Each time this has happened, not only has it been reported as past due on my credit report ( even though it has been completely their fault ), I have also received HUGE interest and late fees. Just so you understand that I am NOT exagerating the problems, our initial loan balance of approximately $ 90K has not reached an insane balance of $ XXXX. That represents $ XXXX in late fees and interests. Having graduated in XX/XX/XXXX, that is just over $ 21K a year in fees and interest ( {$1700.00} a month ). Based off of the estimated payment schedule provided by Navient, the total amount to be repaid is {>= $1,000,000}. There is NO other business or entity that would be allowed to charge these types of interest and fees. Navient has been iether unable or unwilling to provide adequate documentation to substantiate loan balance. Documentation provided does NOT go back to when I graduated from school. Documentation provided does NOT include balances prior to consolidation. Documentation provided does NOT include dates of consolidation. I am by NO means trying to get out of my original debt. And let 's NOT forget that EVERYTHING goes to my ex-husband and I am TOTALLY dependent on receiving information from him. I ca n't even have my own account login to make payments. The system is NOT set up for this type of situation. What I was loaned to go to school should be paid back. However, I have NEVER received a FAIR chance to pay back my loan. I ca n't buy a car. I ca n't buy a house. I went to college to better my life and instead it has been ruined. At every stage of repayment, I have been cheated and taken advantage of. THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE : Even now as I am preparing this, I just logged in to my ex-husband 's account on Navient to find out that the account is in repayment status! I had NO idea! I have not received NOT one notice from Navient that my IBR was approaching the time that I needed to submit my paperwork for the annual verification. Not one letter. Not one e-mail. Nothing. So now the account is going to go past due, my credit report is going to once again be reflected as past due when they failed to provide me my paperwork and notifications required under federal law, and the account is going to stay in past due status until THEY process the IBR paperwork that I did n't even know was due! And even though this has happened repeatedly and I have attempted to refute with the credit bureaus, they have NEVER fixed it. Attached is just a sampling of the correspondences that I have had with them. It does not include the harrassing phone calls that I have received. Nor does it do justice to how I have been spoken to. At one time I even had a representative bring me to tears telling me that I DESERVE to default.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",NC,275XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,6/22/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2556835

XXXX sold my loan to a company called "" XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' and they automatically said that I owed more money than I originally borrowed.

On XXXX, I called XXXX XXXX and asked if I could just repay what I owe to them. XXXX XXXX told me they can not accept any payment for loans. 
My loan had been sold to so many different collection companies that I did not know who the real holder of my account was. I received advice to contact the Department of Education Ombudsman Program, so I filed several cases with them, requesting they look into this.

I called in XXXX and was told a request would be sent reapply the amount to payoff the direct parent plus loan. In XXXX I called again to request the amount be applied to pay off the parent plus loan. I was first told it should have already been done and would now only take @ 24-48 hours. I then asked who regulated fedloan and was sent to a supervisor. The supervisor stated it would take 7-15 days. All communication for requests could only be sent via email. No one could talk to those that process the requests. During this whole time I monitored my fedloan page for any upcoming payments. Balance was always XXXX. XXXX 2017 would have been my first month coming out of grace period. It has been my experience in the past if I made a large payment over what was due the balance was always XXXX. Now that the payment has finally been processed to pay off the parent plus loan my fedloan page is stating I am past due on payments. States I have not made a payment since XXXX 2017. I made a payment of {$420.00} XX/XX/XXXX. Now it states I am late and have a past due amount of {$930.00} yet still have a XXXX balance due for XXXX.

I feel as if I am at a disadvantage and am vulnerable to a loan shark. It took months to resolve this issue and now they are hitting me with past due interest for retaliation for me paying off the parent plus loan. I have always paid off education loans quicker than the designated time frame. My payoff history shows the proof. Now, looking back in my fedloan inbox I see a response stating the payoff was insufficient and my repayment terms have changed. It seems my statement that I would file a formal complaint to who ever regulates them changed their mind and they applied the pay off to the parent plus loan.

I started this plan with XXXX inXX/XX/XXXX and made all of my payments on time. Apparently sometime in XXXX or XXXX XXXX my account was sent to Navient. I was first told by Navient that my payment would continue to be {$17.00} a month which XXXX had previously determined based on my ability to repay with my current income. I was ok with this and agreed to pay the {$17.00}. Fast forward a couple of months to the end of XXXX and Beginning of XX/XX/XXXX I received harassing phone calls and emails from Navient letting me know my payment was past due with a balance over {$500.00}. Shocked, I had no idea why this was so I tried to contact Navient. I was told that I was sent notification that I needed to submit my replacement plan paperwork to figure out what my income based plan would be. I never received that paperwork nor did I ever receive a letter of any kind from Navient. The only contacted me once and that was way back in XXXX XXXX and nothing was said to me about anything I needed to fill out. They gave me no warning when they jumped my payment from {$17.00} to over {$150.00}. I still do not know what my total is a month because I have never received any letter in the mail just threatening collection calls and a threatening email. I understand that Navient is currently in a lawsuit with the CFPB and let me tell you these people at Navient are crooks. I was never informed of my payment change nor was I ever informed that my repayment plan had to be resubmitted despite what they say. I never received any correspondence from Navient related to any reason why my payment would have skyrocketed. Navient are crooks and I will not stop until this issue is fixed nor will I make any payment because it is not a feasible payment. It is about {$130.00} too much a month for me to afford.

'' They said that if I wished to use any of these options there would be initial and monthly fees added on which would actually increase my bill more than what it already was.

2/14/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"Good afternoon, My complaint is just to have a record of the type of problems I've experienced consistently with XXXX XXXX. They service all of my Federal loans as well as my teach grants. Throughout the years I have had problems with the company losing my paperwork, claiming never have to received it, not contacting me about any problems or issues, or not correcting problems after I have called in and thought they were resolved. 

Two examples stand out in my mind. In 2016 I needed to reapply for income-based repayment. At the same time I applied to switch to the revised pay as you earn payment plan. I submitted paperwork in XXXX and needed to follow up with additional documentation. I printed the document available that I found searching their website through XXXX because I couldn't find it through their web page itself. When I mailed it in apparently it was the out of out-of-date form. I looked at the forms and they were the same as far as I could tell, but I printed out the new form and sent it in. This time, they said I missed filling out a section. Therefore I had to fill it out again and send it again. 

At this point, everything was technically my fault, but XXXX XXXX did not contact me in a time of effective manner through the process. I had to call in every time to check on the process. By the time I sent in the third form it was already XXXX, and my due date was at the end of the month. So I sent in the third form via certified mail, and the post office confirmed that the information was received by XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX claim to have never received the form. Finally, a customer service agent suggested that I faxed in the form because it was generally faster that way. I hesitated because I wanted to confirm they had received it, but did it anyway. I don't know why nobody had suggested this before. I suppose I also could have asked about this, but in general XXXX XXXX was not helpful in any suggestions about the best way of doing or accomplishing any tasks that they required. 

After I fax in the information, no one confirmed that they had received it, so I called in again. It took the customer service agent a while to find my information, but confirmed that the fax had been received. Although previous customer service workers had assured me that as long as I got the information in before the XXXX due date of the loan, I believe to be XX/XX/XXXX, everything would be effective for the month of XXXX. That was not the case. 

By the second week of XXXX, I called customer service again to follow up on the status of my application. At this time I found out that I needed to apply for immediate forbearance because the amount I was to pay, over {$900.00}, had not been adjusted. In fact, the paperwork needed to have been processed by XX/XX/XXXX, therefore needed to be received by XXXX XXXX around XX/XX/XXXX in order to adjust the payment amount So, I had the application for forbearance go through, which was effective immediately. It's frustrating that for some reason forbearance is the only service that be provided immediately. At the end of XXXX I followed up to make sure that everything was going correctly. I found out that my forbearance would continue until I was billed at the end of XXXX because they haven't processed my payment plan transition. Throughout this process not even one person was able to call me back to give me some kind of status update. Each time, I had to make room in my schedule for somewhere around an hour 's worth of conversation with XXXX XXXX due to the time on hold, the fact that I required multiple service escalations, and the fact that I had to reassess plane my situation every time, completely, for the new person I spoke to. Everything finally got worked out, but it is unbelievable to me that it took almost half a year for one change to go into effect. 

The reason I'm writing this complaint is because I have just gone through a similarly frustrating situation was XXXX XXXX   although at a different level. I recently applied to refinance three of my high Interest Federal loans with a private bank offering substantially  lower interest. This seemingly simple operation has resulted in multiple phone calls over the last three weeks. 

I gave complete information to my new private lender and they sent out the funds in three separate checks for the three separate loans that I am refinancing. XXXX XXXX received the first two on  XX/XX/XXXX. They applied the payments to all of my loans, not the loans the checks designated. I noticed this and called in to have it fixed a few days after the money posted to the account. The representative could not find the third check for me, but expedited the request to reapply the funds to the appropriate loans. The issue was resolved in a few days. He also noted that a third check was coming and it should be applied to the specific loan I had originally requested. 

When the third check was received by XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I noticed that XXXX XXXX again apply the payment to all of the loans instead of the single loan I wished to refinance with the funds. In addition, some of the funds had been applied to loans with a XXXX balance, showing overpayment on those loans. I called in on XX/XX/XXXX after my account was updated to reflect this problem. The customer service representative submitted a request to reapply the funds to the appropriate loan. He also commented that he marked the request as urgent and should be expedited. I made sure he knew which loan it was and he confirmed by repeating the date, the amount, and the interest rate attached to the loan. He said it should be done by Friday. 

Needless to say, I did not see my account updated on Friday. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I emailed the company because I didn't have time to get on the phone with them. I was requesting a status update. On Wednesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called to follow up again. This time I found out that instead of reapplying the funds appropriately as I had discussed on the previous Tuesday, XXXX XXXX that the money that they overpaid on my XXXX balance loans had just been processed to go back to my private bank. I spoke to three customer service representatives only to find out that they don't know if that action can be cancelled and reapplied to the appropriate loan. There is no one to contact me to update me with any information. Instead, I must again call back, waiting on hold until I get ahold of the right person, to see if they canceled the action in time. If they didn't, I'm going to have to work something out with my private bank. I don't know what that's going to entail, I don't know how long it's going to take, I don't know how many more dollars I'm going to have to pay in interest because of this fiasco, or if that's even information they will have for me on Friday. If they were not able to cancel the action in time, I'm going to have to wait for the whole holiday weekend to go through. If for some reason I have to reapply for additional funds from my private bank, they have to get sent to XXXX XXXX through the XXXX XXXX, and then XXXX XXXX has to apply them to my loan balance, and then I have to call back in so that they're reapplied correctly, it will be another process with XXXX XXXX   that has taken more than a month to resolve. 

My problems with XXXX XXXX can be boiled down to a few points. They have no time effective way of contacting customers in order to let them know changes have occurred, problems have been addressed, the status has been updated. They do not call or inform customers when something has been applied incorrectly, when they are sending funds back to another Institution, or when they can not process a request. The representatives are not trained appropriately because not only did I get conflicting information, some of it was plain wrong. Additionally, the process to fix immediate problems takes way too long. 

One of the terrible things about XXXX XXXX is that I can't choose a different servicer. Additionally, I can not petition anyone in the government to address problems with employees or processes. Because XXXX XXXX contracts with the federal government and essentially blocks borrowers into a frustrating combination of the worst of both the private and public sector, the government really should have more oversight regarding these companies. I don't really think there's anything that the government can do to punish or change the processes of XXXX XXXX right now, but I want people to be aware this issue exists and if there's a pattern, maybe the government can step in or revoke their contract.",,AES/PHEAA,VA,221XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2/14/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2814684
2/20/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"I have made consistent payments since at XXXX, possibly even going back to XXXX. Often times I have doubled my payments in an effort to quickly pay down the principle. When I inquired why my principle was not decreasing I was told that when I made extra payments that accelerated my interest, and any additional money I paid only went to interest instead of the principle. So essentially I had just been giving money away. So for probably the past year I have only been making minimum payments, but I have paid no less than {$290.00} per month every month for the past six years and only approximately {$1900.00} has gone to the principle on my loan. For some reason I have 5 separate loans with Navient. Since I've been making minimum payments I notice they are allocated in a way that I will always have a past due balance on at least one of the loans. For example if I have due payments of {$50.00} for each loan, and I make monthly payments {$250.00} ; one month the {$250.00} will only be allocated to the consolidation loans, then the next month it will be allocated to my other loans and the fees and interest from the previous month.

4/4/17,Student loan,Non-federal student loan,Dealing with my lender or servicer,Don't agree with fees charged,"I joined the XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX with the Student Loan Repayment Program ( SLRP ) in my contract. I applied for the SLRP after the first year of service, like directed to. I received paperwork XXXX from XXXX signed on XX/XX/XXXX. I filled out my section of the XXXX and sent it to my loan servicing agent ( American Education Services aka AES ) on XX/XX/XXXX. There were XXXX separate SLRP XXXX for each of my XXXX loans ( XXXX Federal, XXXX Private ). After receiving XXXX applications from me, AES filled out their section, signed and dated on XX/XX/XXXX, and sent it directly to the XXXX as instructed to complete processing. 
The Issue : AES sent only XXXX SLRP applications out of the XXXX loans applications that were sent to them by me ( These XXXX SLRP applications were for the XXXX Federal loans only, not for the Private loans ). According to AES there was a note on my account that the XXXX Private loan SLRP applications were not approved due to a date discrepancy ( over 60 days between the XXXX signed and dated box XXXX and that they sent a letter via REGULAR MAIL ( not certified ) as the only way of contacting me about the issue. 
Later on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told that the Federal loan apps may have gone through but the private loans did not probably because the applications went to 2 different departments ( one for federal, and one for private ) but they may or may not have had different standard of accepting the dates provided on the XXXX. ( How can one department within AES that handles private loans have significantly different standards than a department that handles federal loans ; and why was n't I notified that these would be going to be processed by 2 separate departments ) I had never received that letter of denial notification, nor was I notified in any other way that those XXXX SLRP private loan applications had been denied ( most likely the physical letter got lost in the mail, or put in the duplex neighbors ' mailbox mistakenly.

At the same time, XXXX had made a payment on my AES account which had indicated to me that XXXX had received all necessary paperwork and AES did what they were supposed to with the paperwork I provided. The lump sum was dispersed to both federal ( the XXXX where paperwork went through fine ) AND to private loans ( the XXXX that apparently did n't have correct paperwork ). AES told me they disperse payments to wherever XXXX directs them to, XXXX told me they have no control over where the money is dispersed after it leaves their hands ) XXXX ( XXXX ) made payments to ALL of the XXXX loans, indicating to me that all XXXX SLRP applications were received and processed. ( Why would I think otherwise? ) Payments were made on XX/XX/XXXX ( dispersed to all XXXX loans ), XX/XX/XXXX ( dispersed to only federal loans ), and XX/XX/XXXX ( dispersed to only federal loans ). 
Because payments were not being made on all loans, and was only a portion of the payment I was entitled to, interest was accruing on a higher balance that what it was supposed to be. 
[ Interest rate x current principle balance / # days in the year ] = daily interest According to this equation provided by AES, my daily interest rate should have been significantly less if the correct payments were made in XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. 
I sent new paperwork on XX/XX/XXXX to AES to be filled out to REDO the SLRP process that had been messed up in XX/XX/XXXX. Private loan applications are currently being processed at XXXX for payment to AES.As the time passes for me to investigate all of the mishaps and miscommunications, my interest is continuing to accrue. I now owe over {$18000.00} due to interest rate accrual, which should be significantly less if done correctly in XX/XX/XXXX.

During that time, Navient began capitalizing my interest ; so now my ~ {$40000.00} student loan is {$87000.00} ( it was more, but I've paid some of it down ). When I make payments, the majority of my payments go mostly, if not all, to interest ; so my principal hardly ever goes down. While I was a graduate student, Navient called me incessantly on the phone for me to make payments. I constantly told them I had no income other than a graduate teaching stipend ; they offered to reduce my interest rate to 1 %, which allowed me to make minimum payments. In XX/XX/XXXX, Navient increased my interest rates to between 11 % on some private loans to 14 % on another. Over the last 24 months, I made 37 payments ( 13 more than required ) totaling {$12000.00} ; 15 of those payments of {$6400.00} went solely to interest ; none of the 15 payments reduced my principal.

This notification came to my permanent home address at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX CA. XXXX, which FedLOan serving had on file approximately 90-120 days after leaving school. 

This was the first notification I received from FedLoan that my account was now due and I needed to set up payment. I immediately responded and made payment arrangements. 
I noticed that they had reported to the Credit Agencies that I was 90 days late. When I called FedLoan Servicing to inquire about the 90 days late, and I had just received my payment notification by mail, they told me that the initial notice of payment went to my XXXX XXXX  University student email, even though they had my permanent mailing address. I of course no longer had access to my student email as I was out of school and so did not receive a notice to begin paying loan. 
I told them for something this important, the first payment due notice should have been mailed to my home address, just as the 90 day notice was. Fedloan acknowledged that they did not send me a bill to my home address. I asked that becasue I never received a bill, I should not have been reported to the credit bureau as delinquent and asked that they remove or correct this with the credit agencies. They told me they do n't do that and I should have known it was due. 
I sent a letter with the same request and also contacted and challenged all 3 credit agencies that I never received an initial bill until 90 days past due. They sent letters to Fedloan but I am sure Fedloan responded that they emailed me. Therefore the 90 day delinquent is on my credit reports and damaging my credit and costing me money in higher interest rates. 
Summary : Since I did not receive an initial bill in the mail, which Fedloan had and chose not to use, I need the 90 day delinquency on all 3 loans taken off my 3 credit reports. It shows as three loans as disbursement was by semester, when it is actually one student loan. I have in fact, already paid about {$7000.00} back already and will pay the loan off.

9/18/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"FedLoan Servicing ( run by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ) has repeatedly put my loans into forbearance due to their inability to properly process paperwork and unreasonably extended the amount of time until I am eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness ( PSLF ) by 9 months. 

I graduated with roughly {$150000.00} in federal student loans ( all XXXX XXXX, XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX and began payments in XXXX XXXX. My loans were first with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and were then transferred to XXXX XXXX. 

I submitted my first PSLF certification paperwork in XXXX and my loans were transferred from XXXX XXXX to FedLoan in XXXX XXXX. For some reason, despite the fact that my Income Based Repayment ( IBR ) plan was valid until XXXX XXXX, FedLoan put me in the XXXX XXXX plan. When I called to get this fixed, they said they saw that I was on the IBR plan at XXXX XXXX and it should have transferred, but they would put my loans into forbearance while they tried to work this issue out ( and failed to mention that would mean those months would not count towards PSLF ). After about 4-5 months, they finally acknowledged I should be in IBR and payments resumed. 

In early XXXX, when I later transferred from the IBR plan to the Pay As You Earn repayment plan, they took several months to process this paperwork and again placed me in forbearance during this time. No one mentioned the impact this would have on PSLF. 

When I checked on my account recently and saw the estimated PSLF eligibility date was now XXXX XXXX when it should have been XXXX XXXX, I called them for an explanation. The customer service rep stated that because I was placed in forbearance during those two incidents for a total of nine months, I lost nine months of eligibility. When I explained that the only reason I was put in forbearance was because FedLoan had failed to properly process documents both times, the service rep stated that there was nothing that could be done and that the PSLF rules simply state any forbearance periods do not count towards eligibility. They did not offer any solution and refused to credit me some of the months that were due to their own processing problems. 

I think it is wrong that the consumer is punished for problems the loan servicer has in processing paperwork in a timely manner. I could understand losing a month or two ( and likely would n't have written in ), but 9 months represents a significant portion of time added to my loan repayment plan. I noticed that the Massachusetts Attorney General filed a complaint regarding this very issue, and that the CFPB has already received many complaints along this line, but wanted to add my voice to the chorus to help drive home how often FedLoan is doing this to consumers.",,AES/PHEAA,DC,200XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/18/17,Closed with non-monetary relief,Yes,N/A,2676945

Prior to my graduation from college 6 years ago, we had been trying to resolve this issue to no avail. 

Once the loan was transferred to Navient, a lot of paperwork was lost between the XXXX service providers, so my Dad and I began trying to remove myself as co-signer from the loan entirely.

Now that my Father is deceased, NAVIENT told me I am the primary loan holder and no longer qualify to be removed as a co-signer, even though they purposefully withheld the process from us for over half-a-decade. 

Knowing now, that we did qualify for several programs that were never offered to us, even though I begged for reasonable programs to do so, we were constantly forced into forbearances that only increased the amount of interest we owed on my loans. There was even a point during the recession where we had all been laid off and we were told Navient 's hands were tied and we would just have to default. They garnished over {$10000.00} in tax returns WHILE MY FATHER HAD XXXX, when they had programs that could have helped us. 

All I ever wanted to do was have the ability to pay back what I owed, instead I was treated like a lowlife looking to get out of repayment, simply because I could not afford it and NAVIENT was actually withholding the programs that could have enabled me to do so.

OnXX/XX/XXXX I made another payment to XXXX XXXX in the amount of {$5.00}. After making the payment I checked my inbox for their website and received a letter stating that my XXXX payment will be on REPAYE. Also in my inbox were two letters dated XX/XX/XXXX. The first letter advised that the administrative forbearance on my account was changed to be from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXXand another letter advised that my account had a reduced payment forbearance from XX/XX/XXXX. The issue that I have is the length of time it took the lender to process my request to be on REPAYE. I was removed from my Income Based Repayment Plan in XX/XX/XXXX and do not expect to be on REPAYE until XX/XX/XXXX. I am seeking to make 120 monthly payments under a qualifying payment plan for XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. These four months that the lender took to process this change are a period of time that is not counted for XXXX because the lender is immediately able to remove you from your qualifying plan, but unable to expediently put you on a new qualifying plan. Additionally, the lender is able to capitalize interest on the loan. The 120 days it took to process my request are very much in excess of the Dept of Ed stated goal of 15 days, and the lenders original stated expectation of between 30 and 60 days. I am wondering if the slow processing of this type of request may net the lender more money as they are handling the loan for a longer period of time and able to capitalize interest on the loan during that period of time. Additionally, had I not continued to call, I am not confident I would have been put on REPAYE at all, perhaps not until sometime until after XX/XX/XXXX. My student loan balance was {$190000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The balance is now {$230000.00} after interest capitalization, an increase of {$40000.00}.

1/9/18,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Trouble with how payments are being handled,"The summary is that Heartland ECSI charged a late fee for a payment I missed. However, when I made the payment they did not apply anything to the late fee and instead let it accrue for several months. After the missed payment I established a monthly withdraw from my bank account to ensure a payment was not missed. So for months my bank account was being charged. But the company never applied any of my payments to the late fee. Nor attempted to notify me that a late fee still applied. 

The late fee was first charge in XXXX in the amount of XXXX and continued into XXXX when I logged in to check this account, under the assumption that it was current, and saw that the amount due ( usually XXXX ) was now XXXX. This is when I saw that none of my payments ever applied to the late fee. However when I applied the first manual payment in XXXX to pay this account I saw that XXXX was due after I made the payment. 

I attempted to deal with the customer service but they insisted that it was my fault for not making a separate payment just for the late fees and that recurring payments would never be applied to a late fee. I was then told that the manual payment that showed XXXX due, only applied to the recurring amount due and that I should have known the late fee would require a separate payment. 

The attachment below shows 3 consecutive billing statements that show a late fee, and show that a payment was received each prior month, but the late fee continues to accrue. 

Finally when setting up recurring payments, the website intentionally does not show the monthly payment amount on the same screen it asks the user to input a monthly amount to be charged from their bank. there is no selection available that allows the user to pay the minimum amount due or show any other previous payments for reference. This means that the user must either guess, or navigate away from this screen to find out. This is clearly an intentional attempt to get users to underpay without knowing it and be charged a late fee.",,HEARTLAND PAYMENT SYSTEMS INC,CA,,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,1/9/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2776513

While the name is different, the same TERRIBLE customer service still exists. No, I 'm not behind in my payments and actually pay 2 weeks before the due date. I should not have to call every couple of months because the corporation ca n't do its job with payment allocation, tells me I 'm over a month behind on payments, and gives me late fees!

I decided to switch how my payments were applied and paid off a vehicle that was very close to being paid off. 

On XX/XX/XXXX I looked at my student loans, and because of what my XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  billing statement said at the time I decided to adjust what I was paying. My statement said that I was paid ahead by {$4300.00} and my next required payment was not due for 14 months. 

So I changed my payments, while continuing to pay {$100.00} per month to continue my paid ahead status. When I was completed paying off my vehicle, on XX/XX/XXXX my balance had not changed so I didn't think anything of it. My statement said that I was still paid ahead by nearly {$600.00} and I didn't have to make a payment until XX/XX/XXXX. 

So I started back up making payment well above my required amount to further reduce this debt. But after a few months of making these payments, not a single dollar was reducing the debt. They were applying to accrued interest and nothing off the principle. But 4 month later on my XX/XX/XXXX billing statement ( while they were not applying any to principle ) I was paid ahead at {$1000.00} and didn't owe a payment until XX/XX/XXXX. 

Not only did they not disclose the payment were being charged to accrued interest, they did not give me updated statement balances, and they held my money that I had paid and didn't apply it correctly. 

This company is acting fraudulently and in bad faith to not only me but I would venture to guess Thousands of consumers who are using them for their student loans. If they are telling me I am paid ahead, that money should have been used to cover any accrued interest, and or been applied to straight principle.

Throughout the process of closing the estate, the lawyers we hired to complete the process never once mentioned or brought up the fact that, under the policies of Navient and the loan, they would call the loan in default and due in full. Sometime in XX/XX/XXXX, I received calls and letters from XXXX XXXX ( their deceased collection agency. ) During this time, which did n't make any sense, Navient finally contacted me, in which I was at work and unable to field the phone call. I, over the course of the next few weeks, attempted to contact the representative who was 'in charge ' of my account. On a number of occasions, I tried to just speak with anyone but no one could help, as I was told I had to speak with my 'case manager. ' Finally, after speaking with the 'manager ' of my case, she informed me that I had 3 choices. 1 ) Pay the account off in full. 2 ) Find another co-signer ( something I 'm not willing to do, considering this possible outcome. ) 3 ) Find another company to lend me the money to pay it off. In my opinion, this can perceived as 'predatory ' collection practices. I 'm a customer of Navients, whom pays their bill every month. Admittedly, I had some repayment options early on, but I 've corrected those issues and now how a steady flow of income and have made payments every month since XX/XX/XXXX, which they 're unwilling to consider.

'' Without being properly served, I can not respond appropriately to this letter. However, I suspect that this relates to an issue that I have been continuously dealing with since XX/XX/XXXX when I sent ECMC a "" Cease and Desist '' after they improperly contacted my employer multiple times. Since that time, I have demonstrated how I paid for my education ( which I did not have the burden to do ), and I have filed complaints with the FTC, CFPB, California State Attorney General, two Senators and my local police. ECMC previously attempted to utilize an invalid document to attempt to claim that I have a student loan. The document did not have my signature, listed fraudulent information, and did not have the name of ECMC or any financial institution ( lender ) or guarantor anywhere on the form. The form was not an original, and the scan clearly reveals a form of media manipulation because the lines are not even straight. The dates are also completely inaccurate. Further, the amounts that ECMC claims far exceed the tuition for the time I attended graduate school : {$26000.00} for the entire program. It 's unfortunate that tuition has skyrocketed and outpaced inflation for the current generation, but using today 's dollar figures and attaching them to XX/XX/XXXX is just absurd. Although it is challenging to take any of this seriously, the fact is that ECMC will again go on to contact my work, and I am mired in a process in which I can not get them to leave me alone, even though I have responded to the shifted burden of proof in this country and demonstrated that I DO NOT OWE anything. The burden of proof should require debt verification and validation on ECMC 's part, but yet again, here we are with their incapability of providing a proper mailing. I have an existing "" Notice of Intent to Sue '' for the State of California, and I intend to go to court over this matter. I fundamentally believe that ECMC needs to be investigated for financial fraud. I do not know why this organization has my information, and I do not know why they are creating fake documents to attempt to harass me and my employer. I work for a XXXX, and we do n't have time to be dealing with this for several hours each week. At first, I just wanted this to stop, but now I want compensatory and punitive damages. After all of this time ( XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX ), the individuals working for ECMC have still failed to provide a legal debt instrument.

12/19/17,Student loan,Private student loan,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"The party submitting this complaint is Borrower-Spouse B for purposes of protection of personal information. 
The Loan Service Provider ( LSP ) has unilaterally XXXX a fictitious legal framework over Borrower-Spouse Bs financial responsibilities by applying an erroneous limited co-signer repayment liability framework, despite the terms of the Master Promissory Note ( MPN or contract ) expressly stipulating a joint Spousal Consolidation Loan ( SCL ) meant to create a unified contractual recognition of co-borrowers, derived from Borrower-Spouse Bs and Borrower-Spouse As individually-borrowed loans. 
By unilaterally transferring his role to one of co-signer of a regular consolidation loan, the LSP has not only prevented Borrower-Spouse B from equally accessing the rights and benefits available to co-borrowers under the terms of the joint contract he did sign, but they have also imposed the limitations and full financial and legal burden for an individual loan he did not sign.

The LSP has thusly denied or prevented Borrower-Spouse B from acting in any way equal to Borrower-Spouse A under the terms of this spousal loan, at the same time that they constantly and exclusively refer to a MPN for a joint SCL that was approved without any loans for Borrower-Spouse B. 
Borrower-Spouse B has attempted to have himself released from this loan because of his lack of legal consideration, but XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX. ( doing business as XXXX XXXX XXXX ), and now Nelnet ( all LSPs are treated as a single entity under the terms of transference ) have all denied this request. 
The signed MPN does not contain a section for a voluntary co-signor, as it was meant to provide for the consolidation of loans held by two separate but married borrowers. A loan consolidation form for a single individual with a co-signor was not submitted, although it was an available option at the time. 
In Section B. Spouse Information, the form expressly states Only complete this section if your spouse has eligible loans and you both wish to consolidate jointly. If you complete Section B, also include your spouses loan ( s ) in section D.1 and D.2. Your spouse must also sign and date item 38 in Section G. 
Section F of the MPN also provides for treating both signatories to the contract as a single unit. Section F further states, If I am applying jointly with my spouse, I further understand that my Federal Consolidation Loan will be fully discharged only if both of us qualify for discharge, and may be partially discharged if only one of us qualifies for discharge. 
The signed MPN was used specifically for consolidating loans held by both parties in a marriage, and specifically states that the spouses information was to be filled in only if the spouses loan information was included in part D of the application. The MPN was approved without any of the financial consideration due Borrower-Spouse B, but he has since been held financially and legally liable for the full amount that exclusively reflects Borrower-Spouse As prior loans. 
On XX/XX/2017, Borrower-Spouse A unilaterally, and without consulting with or informing Borrower-Spouse B, requested a change in the repayment terms. The change was processed by the LSP without consulting or seeking consent from Borrower-Spouse B. In a prior CFPB case requesting release, the LSP did not address the issue of their own recognition of the fault in the MPN that had them treating Borrower-Spouse B as a mere co-signor instead of an equal borrower. Instead, they addressed his request to be released by stating that Borrower-Spouse B 's and Borrower-Spouse As change in marital status does not affect his individual liability under the terms of the very same contract they are not honoring.

Borrower-Spouse B never alleged or argued that the divorce between him and Borrower-Spouse A should relieve him of any contractual duties. The divorce was mentioned to explain the court-ordered context of his being the sole payee over the history of the loan, and the fact that, despite the joint aspect of the loan, Borrower-Spouse B is denied access to or otherwise prevented, by both the LSP and Borrower-Spouse A, from accessing financial legal protection tools and resources, in addition to rights and benefits such as filing income tax deductions for the loan payments he has exclusively made ( Borrower-Spouse A has unlawfully claimed this deduction totaling nearly {$4000.00} to date because Borrower-Spouse B has been denied the information necessary to file ).

The LSP denied Borrower-Spouse B his rights under any possible joint loan when they changed the terms of repayment without consulting with him or seeking his consent, and while they continue to deny him full access to the account, including disclosure documents and other communications. While the unilateral change in repayment terms has already been addressed and reverted, the conditions under which the provider permitted this and took action upon it remain and continue to be legally and functionally contrary to the signers intent and consent. The LSP continues to deny the fault in the MPN, imposing unilateral terms from a contract that does not exist.",,"NELNET, INC.",CO,805XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,12/19/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2759148

I filed the application on XX/XX/XXXX for XX/XX/XXXX. I renewed the application in XX/XX/XXXX for the XX/XX/XXXX fiscal year. I filed electronically and via hardcopy USPS along with a certified letter requesting that if there were any discrepancies to please contact me immediately via phone or US mail since I was locked out of the web portal with an "" error 404 '' page since XX/XX/XXXX. Also there was something wrong with their phone system. I had attempted for many months to contact Navient and was either put on hold for an hour or more, then disconnected, or every time I called I could hear them but they could not hear me. So I have had no access to my account since XX/XX/XXXX and although many attempts have initiated by me, none of them has supplied me with access to my account. This was the reason I filed both electronically and via hardcopy USPS for the year XX/XX/XXXX renewal. I heard nothing from Navient until approx XX/XX/XXXX. They did not have the status of my loan, just were demanding payment. I advised them I was in XXXX income status, but they continued to email and call several times a day demanding payment. I called frequently trying to get this straightened out but keep getting transferred to another party and always invariable disconnected. I have sent 7 certified letters invoking my right to have all correspondence in writing via US Mail due to their inability to provide me access to my account and because of the lack of telephone service. Each time Navient calls I tell them immediately that I am in XXXX income status and request that they send any information in writing via US mail. On XX/XX/XXXX I have received 5 calls from people who say they are from Navient, or are subsidiaries of Navient but do not have access to my account requesting payment for a loan that is in XXXX income status. One of their subsidiary companies calling from an XXXX Texas area code is demanding I send them a "" Cease and desist '' letter before they will stop calling me at all hours of the day and night. I have filed a complaint with the Texas State Attorney General Consumer Protection Agency. I have addressed certified mail to a XXXX XXXX, who sends me regular emails that can not be replied to requesting I log onto the web portal that I do not have access to. I have consistently received invoices for loan payments post dated after the due date on the invoice with late fees attached during the entire time I have been in forbearance, deferment or XXXX income status. The principle on this loan was paid in full in XX/XX/XXXX. They are now demanding more than twice the amount of the loan in interest only with exorbitant late fees charged while I was in Deferment, forbearance or XXXX income status. I am veteran of XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. So if there are any military programs to assist with this loan, I would greatly appreciate any information you may be able to share with me.

9/27/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Problem with customer service,"I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX and I have been making payments on my loans to count towards the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program for 5 years. As a XXXX, I often take courses to keep up my XXXX license just as I did this past summer of 2017. I took a three hour graduate course and I was not notified that XXXX XXXX would place my loans in a deferment which I did not ask for and I continued to make my monthly payment as this was going on. I was not alerted of the deferment until XX/XX/XXXX and the deferment started on XXXX XXXX, 2017! If I was alerted in XX/XX/XXXX, why did the deferment start in XX/XX/XXXX? Once I received an email, I called XXXX XXXX and they sent me a waiver form to fill out so that the deferment could be lifted. I faxed it in three days later on XXXX2017 and instead of taking it off immediately, I found out that my loans were then placed in a forbearance which I also did not ask for! Finally, on XX/XX/XXXX I after a 15 minute wait, I was able to speak with XXXX and she bluntly told me that it did n't matter when I sent the waiver into them, that my loans would not go into repayment until they decided to do so after they reviewed my request. All she wanted to tell me that that my loans were in repayment for XX/XX/XXXX. I was never notified of the deferment and then asked for it to be removed, it seems that XXXX XXXX does things on their own time schedule. Now because of their slow turnaround time, I have missed out on 5 payments that I actually paid that will not count towards Public Service Loan Payment Credit. I honestly believe that this was done on purpose to keep me in debt longer as I clearly stated each time that I spoke with them that I did not want a deferment or a forbearance because my payments were not counting towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness. If the original deferment was to  end XXXX17 and I asked for it to be removed, why did XXXX XXXX then no only remove the deferment promptly but added a forbearance which prolonged the amount of time I was not receiving credit for payments under XXXX XXXX? 

To add to the problem, I received an email yesterday from XXXX XXXX stating that my Income Driven Payment Request was denied. No details, just an email stating it had been denied. My husband and I filled out the online forms to have our tax forms sent to them back in XX/XX/XXXX. He is away with the military for five months and I do not get to talk to him on a regular basis. So I do n't know when he will be able to fill out his portion of the online form again. I ca n't afford a higher payment. I think that XXXX XXXX has been improperly factoring in my spouse 's income and preventing me from re-certifying for the ICR/IBR/PAYE plans. 

I asked what I should do and XXXX was not helpful with details. I need to be in an income based repayment plan so that I can make my loan payments and stay in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. I asked if the deferment and forbearance could be removed retroactive to last XXXX 2017 so that the payments I made would count towards PSLF and she told me there was no way that would happen. It has been very frustrating to say the least when dealing with XXXX XXXX  and their incompetence customer service representatives.",,AES/PHEAA,NC,282XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,9/27/17,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2685813

I started to repay my loans that year. It was initially financed by XXXX into a 20 year loan with payments of XXXX. My original loan balance was XXXX on loan # 1 and XXXX on loan # 2. So the total would be XXXX. Total payments with interest over 20 years would be XXXX at XXXX. My account was sold to Navient in XX/XX/XXXX after I went through bankruptcy following a horrible split with my children 's father. I was not given the option to sell. I did not sign papers for new finance terms nor would I have agreed to extending my loan for an additional 20 years. In the end of XX/XX/XXXX, around XX/XX/XXXX, I took a close look at my Navient account because the balance seemed to never decrease. It was then that I saw the years that I paid on the loan before they obtained it had not been credited to my account. After multiple attempts for resolution and calls to Navient with no acknowledgement that I existed, I filed a complaint with the XXXX XXXX XXXX. I then received a message from XXXX XXXX with customer relations. I attempted to return her call several times. When I finally got her on the phone, I was basically told I was wrong and I had never paid on the loan prior. Cut to several months later after sending multiple documents from my original loan to prove I was not a liar it seemed I was heard. I received an email stating I had a new document at Navient. I checked and it appeared my balance was corrected to XXXX for the total of the two loans  combined. ( I was also charged almost 6k in interest for what they say was time I was not paying on the loan ). The balance I had when I looked at the number was around 12k. So we were closer. I checked my XXXX  report the next month and it too showed the decreased balance. I received multiple emails the month of XX/XX/XXXX stating I owed different amounts for my next monthly payment. I was alarmed and called XXXX. She told me it was a mistake but my payment would be going up to XXXX/month to pay off the loan at the original scheduled payoff date of XX/XX/XXXX. Low and behold, the next thing I know my account is messed up more than ever. It is showing that none of the payments I make go to principle. My overall balance combined it at XXXX. Also, the monthly balance on the loan from the start of my paying with Navient never changes from XX/XX/XXXX to present. The balance every month is XXXX per loan after payment. I made multiple attempts to contact the company. I have refiled once again with the XXXX but I do not think they can help me. The last time I spoke with XXXX, she pretty much made up all she could blaming in on circumstances listed on their generic email. Her excuses were "" you have not been paying enough on the loan to cover interest. '' Then she moves on to "" you were in forebearance during bankruptcy ''. I was but that doesn't explain this mess and that was only for a short time. Then she said my interest rate had changed ... it should have never changed from the start of the original loan. Even at 5.75 % it would not explain still. Also, when I logged on to print the information for this, I have not been credited payments for XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX this year. They have removed the amount owed on the detailed list but I do have proof at home as well as multiple other documents. Just to recap a little, the original balance listed on my Navient loan after 16 years of payments on a 20 year loan, is higher than the original balance in XX/XX/XXXX.

10/4/17,Student loan,Federal student loan servicing,Dealing with your lender or servicer,Received bad information about your loan,"I am continuing my complaint against AES/PHEAA, as they concluded their investigation a fee weeks ago, XX/XX/XXXX, into my the student loans they allege are mine. 

They determined they actually never had my loans, and were not my original loan servicer of my student loans, and the student loans they had were in fact, not mine. Yet they made a hefty {$30000.00} plus profit from these loans, thus their reason to not correct their mistake they know they made. They do n't want to give it back. plain and simple Greed on their part. and why they wont correct and update XXXX, and why they refuse to notify XXXX XXXX they knowing illegally sold them false student loans. 

I spoke to the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, regardng these loans. She reviewed each chronology of each loan. She saw the mistakes AES/PHEAA has made. 

The/She saw that There are 2 issues going on here. 

First, she saw my evidence i sent them, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, and the XXXX XXXX XXXX, which prove these are not my loans. As nothing matches. Loan amounts Loan dates, Loan Disbursment Dates, student status, grants, scholarships, etc. 

Documents, I refuse to provide to AES/PHEAA, They asked me for several times already, my guess is so they have another chance to maniplate additional numbers to match their numbers. Plus i also sent XXXX, all AES written responses alleging I had 6 loans, instead of 4, although, they have not listed the other 2 loans on XXXX website. My guess is because they know they do n't exist. And that 's their cover up for the added 2 loans they claim I owe, which I explain below. 

Not sure what their explanation will be for why my grants and scholarships dont match theirs, will be. But I Ca n't wait to hear it what their excuse will be. 

Their 2nd mistake, which XXXX office clearly saw yesterday while she did a chronology history of each and every loan while on the phone with me, when she followed the loans history, is that AES/PHEAA somehow pick them up my paid off loans from XXXX XXXX college, in XX/XX/XXXX, alleged I stilled owed the debt, and included that debt, a 3rd loan in the 2nd consolidation that they did and sent that money to themselves, then they sent these 3 loans to a different dept, Aes/PHEAA, which they then had 3 student loans, not 2, {$5600.00}, XXXX, {$5400.00}. Then, AES did something ( I do n't know ), XX/XX/XXXX, I 'm guessing they did another consolidation, combining the 2 XXXX XXXX College Loans, into 1, thus adding $ XXXX {$5600.00}, plus fees, and sold these loans, to XXXX XXXX as 2 XXXX XXXX College Consolidation Loans , XX/XX/XXXX, one Loan {$13000.00}, {$7900.00}, for {$18000.00}, plus {$12000.00} payments they collected from me, making a healthy {$30000.00} profit off these loans. 

They did however consolidate these loans again, adding in these already paid off old loans, then got rid of them by selling them quickly selling them to XXXX XXXX 6 months later, XX/XX/XXXX. Attempting to cover up what they did. Selling them as XXXX XXXX College student loans, not XXXX XXXX XXXX loans. Which also explains why AES/PHEAA HAS absoutely no documents for these loans, only promissary notes from XXXX XXXX XXXX promissary Note. 

AES/PHEAA can not locate any loan documents or promissary notes, from their records, XXXX XXXX XXXX, or XXXX. 
because these loans documents dont exist, as AES/PHEAA never had my loans. 

Now several Federal Goverent Agencies, including XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX all are now investigating and doing their own chronology on these loans, and are telling me they will be discharged or cancelled. 

Its only a matter of time before this comes back and Haunts AES/PHEAA and bite them in the XXXX, for illegally selling false student loans back to the Federal Government. If it was me I would have already done the right thing, and returned my money, request the loans be returns and cancel them, before the XXXX  goverment is the one coming after me. The XXXX office of the XXXX yesterday, said was forwarding these loans to the XXXX to review. I dont know exactly what that means, but i know it only helps my case. AES is only digging a bigger hole. I 'm am also speaking to phillynews, which does n't hurt my case at all either. 

XXXX XXXX saw exactly how AES added rhese old loans in, and knows 2 old student loans that had been paid off, and saw that they were included in AES CONSOLIDATION.

XXXX XXXX account number with Navient is XXXX and his loan number is XXXX.
<P/>
My brother was not working and had XXXX medical conditions, living with my parents and relying on them for all care. On XX/XX/XXXX my brother 's body was discovered XXXX XXXX XXXX after XXXX XXXXt for 7 days. He was pronounced deceased XXXX XXXX XXXX. An XXXX was required and the final death certificate was released onXX/XX/XXXX ( attached ).
<P/>
My parents are XXXX and XXXX years old, living on a fixed income reliant on social security. I supported my parents in managing notification to all medical providers and Navient to get the accounts closed. My brother left no estate and instead died with many outstanding bills.
<P/>
On XX/XX/XXXXI contacted Navient and spoke with XXXX  and he indicated I needed to submit to them the death certificate once it is released and then they would close out the loan. On XX/XX/XXXX I mailed Navient the death certificate ( attached ). On the next bill from Navient it was addressed to my father ( attached ), so I contacted Navient to check on the status of getting the loan cancelled. They told me it can take several months for the death certificate to be processed.
<P/>
Over the past 3 months Navient has called my parent 's home up to 10 times a day, sometimes as late as XXXX XXXX, asking for the loan to be repaid. During the first month my parents would explain that my brother was deceased and that the loan should be closed. I called Navient twice during this time period and each time was told that they had not processed the death certificate yet  and that it can take time to be processed. I let them know that each call Navient makes causes XXXX XXXX to my parents because they find it so difficult to speak about my brother 's death. They assured me the calls would stop.
<P/>
I told my parents to stop answering Navient 's calls because they assured me they would cancel the loan once the death certificate was processed. Last week I called them to check on the status and they informed me that they will no longer speak with me. I asked why and they said that my father was a co-signer on the loan so they will only work through him. I explained that I was not aware of this and said that my father will have a difficult time speaking with them because he will get confused about what is going on. I also indicated my parents never mentioned anything about co-signing and if it did happen my father likely did not understand what he was doing.
<P/>
I subsequently spoke with my parents and my father indicate he recalls signing a form to help my brother but did not realize it meant he would have to repay my brother 's debt. As I previously stated, my father is XXXX years old, living on a fixed income. He is a veteran and was in the XXXX.
<P/>
Today ( XX/XX/XXXX ) I called Navient to ask them to forgive the loan and they ended up asking me to repay the loan on behalf of my parents. I explained that I simply can not, that I already help pay for basic living essentials for my parents. I asked them for any consideration and they indicated that they will not even reduce the payment and the loan must be paid. I do n't know where else to turn and appreciate any help you can provide to my family to have this loan forgiven in full.

They made it really hard for me to bring the principal down. In several occasions I also paid an extra amount above the regular monthly payment but I did not see any evidence that I was making any progress. So, I decided to refinance with a different student loan company, XXXX. They approved my application for refinancing and sent the payoff check for {$120000.00} to Navient on XX/XX/XXXX. According to XXXX, the payoff check was cashed by Navient on XX/XX/XXXX ( unfortunately XXXX   sends the payoff checks via regular mail, so it takes a while to reach the other lender ), but my loan still remains unpaid and the interest keeps accruing on both the Navient and XXXX  loan. I contacted Navient today and I was told that they have no records that a payoff check has been received by them. This is totally non-sense since they cashed the check. How long do I need to wait to see my loan with Navient paid off? Since my loan with Navient is still outstanding, on XX/XX/XXXX I sent another monthly payment to make sure I am current with them.",,"Navient Solutions, LLC.",GA,301XX,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,3/27/18,Closed with explanation,Yes,N/A,2856211
